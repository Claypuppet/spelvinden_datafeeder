You need only a number of thieves and other scum to put these plans into practice. Fortunately, the city is packed with unemployed rogues who linger in bars, at pool halls and by the race course waiting for a chance to make easy money. Gather the best thieves and rob various locations in the city so as to go home with the most money at the end of the day.In Crooks you assume the role of a mafia boss and want to use your thieves tactically to increase your earnings or to thwart others. To do this you must:    Look for the best thieves: Visit hangouts in the city and choose from the thieves available, taking into account that whomever you don't choose will work for your opponents!    Balance tactics and bluffing: The choice is yours ... thwart others or immediately carry out your own plans?    Use your cards wisely: Some thieves can also perform special actions, which increase your chances of winning.The second edition of Crooks features a cardboard box (instead of a tin), updated cards (with some crooks having new ranks), the removal of the Kingpin, a changed pickpocket rule, and a new type of card: the Support Crew, which affects the rank of the cards on its left or right.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, MafiaMechanisme: Hand ManagementMakersOntwerper: Neil Crowley]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/42-crooks.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/30832-home_default/crooks.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/42-crooks.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026300463","WGG1201-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#322.000000}"

"90c5e030-e8d3-4a41-a0c1-c47ac8a2b7e8","<![CDATA[Het Verboden Eiland (NL)]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price. For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.From the publisher's website:Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step!

On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards, and activate buildup cards.In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.The game's attraction lies with the many special cards.

Two Kahuna - ancient sorcerers of the Pacific - compete for dominance on an archipelago consisting of twelve small islands. Using their magic and wisdom, they struggle for control of the islands. They anxiously await the cards handed to them by fate. But when the time is right, they move to capture one, two, or even more islands, trying to gain the upper hand. At the mercy of the magical powers of the South Seas, they quickly realize that even the best magic is no good without strategy.""Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna – part of its Kosmos two-player series – is the best known implementation of this design.It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island – which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.The game is played in three rounds. A round ends when all cards from the face down deck and the three face up cards have been taken. Then points are scored for the islands with a marker stone on them. The game can also end sooner when one player has absolutely NO bridges left on the board.The Kosmos edition has excellent graphics and nice wooden pieces and plays very well.Reimplements:     Arabana-IkibitiReimplemented by:     KanaloaAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Abstract StrategyMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Take ThatMakersOntwerper: Günter Cornett]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/61-kahuna.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/15658-home_default/kahuna.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/61-kahuna.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","19.95","8718026300968","WGG1302","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#250.000000}"

The deck consists of 64 regular cards and two wild cards; each of the 64 cards contains three properties – color, shape and number – with each property coming in four different types. The two wild cards are identical and can be played in place of any other specific single card. They can also be recycled by a player who can replace a wild card with a card that works in that position.To set up the game, each player is dealt a hand of four cards and one card – the ""starter"" – is placed face-up on the table. The remaining cards form a draw deck.On a turn you can add 1-4 cards connected to the grid established by the starter card. All cards must be placed in the same line. A line consists of 2, 3 or 4 cards in a row in which each individual property (color, shape and number) is either the same on each card or different on each card. You can also choose to pass and place some, none or all of your cards on the bottom of the draw pile and take new ones.Maximum line length is four cards. Cards needn't be placed right next to each other as long as they are in the same line, and some spaces on the grid will be impossible to fill.To score a turn, add up the face values of cards in lines either created or extended on that turn. If any of those cards are part of two lines, they're counted twice. If on a turn a player completes a line that is four cards long, all points for the entire turn are doubled. Double again for any additional four card lines created. Double again if you play all four cards on a single turn. A four-card line is called a lot.The game ends when the draw pile is depleted and one player plays his last card. Double points for that turn. The game is over.

Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.
On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.
When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.

You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down — that is, with the color hidden — in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.On a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards — but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.If a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.When a player has ""locked"" two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color — the more numbers crossed off, the more you score — then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points. Whoever scores the most points wins!For a variant, Qwixx: Das Kartenspiel includes eleven multicolored joker cards, also numbered 2-12, that are shuffled into the deck. A player determines the color of this card only when playing it on her turn.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Hand Management, Open DraftingMakersOntwerper: Steffen Benndorf, Reinhard Staupe]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/94-qwixx-het-kaartspel.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/15693-home_default/qwixx-het-kaartspel.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/94-qwixx-het-kaartspel.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026301422","WGG1408","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#130.000000}"

In this version everything is bigger, the players have boards with dry erase markers in place of the original paper and pencil.  This edition is also for up to 8 players instead of only 5 in the original game.  The biggest change in this edition, though, is that on the back of the regular player boards are the Qwixx Mixx boards that have the colors scrambled throughout the different lines, which changes many of the strategies while keeping the mechanisms largely the same.The rules for Qwixx:Qwixx is a quick-playing dice game in which everyone participates, no matter whose turn it is. Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-12 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 12-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.On a turn, the active player rolls six dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows, then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you mark off the 2 or 12 in a row and have at least five numbers marked in that row, you get to also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately. Players then tally their points for each color, sum these values, then subtract five points for each marked penalty box. Whoever has the highest score wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-8Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: DiceMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Paper-and-PencilMakersOntwerper: Steffen Benndorf]]>","boardgames","23.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/96-qwixx-deluxe.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/15697-home_default/qwixx-deluxe.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/96-qwixx-deluxe.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","23.95","8718026301361","WGG1344","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#280.000000}"

After trying to raise funds by any means at the ""All Rivers"" Poker tournament, the Padre recruits a band of gunslingers for the task and, once complete, travels back to the village over the precipitous Los Quantos bridge – all the while harassed by a detachment of the General's men. There they fortify Malpaso itself, and usher the frightened villagers into the abandoned silver mine for protection.When the bandits finally attack, both sides are prepared. Mapache's men unleashing their Gatling gun to devastating effect, while the villagers have a few tricks of their own. Both sides will suffer many casualties in the calamitous battle, but will the Mexican Army arrive in time to put an end to the bloodshed?Revolver 2: Last Stand at Malpaso is a two-player card game set in the Old West, in which one player takes the role of General Mapache and his band of thieving outlaws, and the other player controls the villagers and guardians hired to protect the town of Malpaso, led by the infamous Padre Esteban. Each player has a unique deck of cards with unique possibilities as well as different winning conditions, which requires different tactics and different methods of play.More than just new locations, Revolver 2 features brand new gameplay elements in players can use a mine cart-mounted Gatling gun, blow up a bridge, assemble their own team of gunfighters, and dynamite mine tunnels. The game also includes a terrific Stud Poker mini-game which determines in which town the initial firefights occur.Like the original Revolver, the game remains elegantly simple and can be learned in five minutes. That said, Revolver 2 is a standalone game and the cards from Revolver and its expansions (red packaging) are not interchangable with Revolver 2 and its expansions (green packaging).AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: American West, Bluffing, Card Game, FightingMechanisme: Hand ManagementMakersOntwerper: Leigh Caple, Mark Chaplin]]>","boardgames","17","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/108-revolver-2-dutch-only.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/15709-home_default/revolver-2-dutch-only.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/108-revolver-2-dutch-only.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","17","8718026300784","WGG1223-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#700.000000}"

Cardinal Richelieu is centralizing power in the name of King Louis XIII and defends France against those he considers its enemies: the English, the protestants, the Habsburgs and French nobles scheming against him and the crown. Will you side with the cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the queen and foreign nations? Be warned that the cardinal will hinder too ambitious intrigants. Become an influent noble in the court by accumulating prestige and favors. The player most helpful to each faction is also rewarded at the end of the game.Richelieu is a tactical game with a lot of bluff and interaction, with intrigue everywhere. Every instance of intrigue will pit Cardinal Richelieu against his enemies. The players are nobles taking sides in these intrigues by placing agents with secret values and thus influencing the intrigues. Will you choose to side with Richelieu or the conspirators – or perhaps even help both? You can keep your support secret or make it directly known to others when placing your agents at the intrigues. It costs money to place agents, but the winning faction gives higher rewards for the players that helped them the most.The Cardinal's mood is influenced by his success or failures, and he will become intolerant against too influential nobles (i.e. the players), who will have one fewer action to spend during a turn as a result.There are many possibilities and opportunities to score points for the player who foresees and thwarts the plans of other players.

This desperate battle has recently seen a new player, a secret Agency of Bounty Hunters, attempting to control the endless assaults on inner city life.Your task: Defeat and arrest criminals, defuse high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy city districts, and prevent assassins from completing their destructive path. You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as ""The Agency"", created to control Rain City's crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions – destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents – in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms.

Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship’s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 120 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Aviation / Flight, Fantasy, TransportationMechanisme: Area Movement, Commodity Speculation, Dice Rolling, Modular Board, Pick-up and DeliverMakersOntwerper: Gioacchino Prestigiacomo]]>","boardgames","45","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/641-sky-traders.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/16045-home_default/sky-traders.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/641-sky-traders.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","45","9781616613372","FFDU19-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1128.000000}"

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?Eldritch Horror is a co-operative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One – that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition – or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a ""reckoning effect"" which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-8Speelduur: 120 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Fighting, Horror, Novel-based, TravelMechanisme: Action Points, Cooperative Game, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Resource to Move, Role Playing, Solo / Solitaire Game, Stat Check Resolution, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Corey Konieczka, Nikki Valens]]>","boardgames","72.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/676-eldritch-horror.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/16047-home_default/eldritch-horror.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/676-eldritch-horror.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","72.95","9781616617660","FFEH01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2220.000000}"

Tolkien in his beloved classic. Its characters, enemies, and scenarios are drawn directly from the first half of the novel. The three new scenarios in The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill can be played one at a time, or they can be linked to form a campaign that allows players to relive Bilbo's dramatic story arc!Bilbo Baggins is included as a hero and adds a new sphere of influence to the game: the Baggins sphere. Baggins sphere tokens can be used not only to pay for Baggins sphere and neutral cards, but they can be used to get yourself out of sticky situations via a number of game effects that change with each scenario. While Baggins can gain resources and take actions like other heroes, he is so central to the story that if he leaves play, the players automatically lose.The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill introduces a new type of card  treasure  and players acquire these treasure cards, which represent Middle-earth's most valuable items, only by completing scenarios, with treasure then carrying over into subsequent scenarios. Don't find all the treasure that you suspect is present in a scenario?

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-8Speelduur: 90 min.Leeftijd: 13+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Card Game, Dice, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Novel-basedMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Dice Rolling, Die Icon Resolution, Modular Board, Re-rolling and Locking, Solo / Solitaire Game, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Richard Launius, Kevin Wilson]]>","boardgames","45.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/731-elder-sign.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/16059-home_default/elder-sign.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/731-elder-sign.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","45.95","9781616611354","FFSL05","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1500.000000}"
"ad2cbd34-64e6-4312-acf5-b5ce7310fc5a","<![CDATA[Olympus]]","<![CDATA[In the Ancient Greece, the poleis (city-states) thrived increasing their population and culture, occasionally waging war against each other, erecting buildings and celebrating ceremonies to get the favour of the deities abiding on Mount Olympus. The players will lead one of these city-states (like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Argos and others) expanding it and worshipping the various gods in order to become the hegemonic power of the Peloponnesus!Olympus is a deterministic (i.e., non-random) strategy game, based on worker-placement, resource management and building an efficient engine to score victory points (VPs). It also features a few more aggressive options than the average game based on the same premises (but the savvy player knows how to defend against them, if he prefers to quietly develop his own position).Each player leads a city-state that is defined by six values representing population, culture, military and productivity of the three resources (grain, venison and fish). During your turn, you send one of your three priests to worship one of the ten deities (Zeus, Hera, Demetra, Artemis, Poseidon, Athena, Aphrodite, Ares, Hephaestus or Apollo). Each opponent can now send one of his priests to celebrate the ceremony with you. After that, the deity grants his favor to whoever has sent a worshipper: the favor is larger for the leading priest (the one of the active player) and smaller for all the others (for example, Athena boosts culture by two points for the city of leading priest and by one point for the others; of course no boost is given to those who refused to send a priest to worship her). That deity cannot be chosen again in the current turn.Since almost all deities are specialized in a certain field, the players must choose which ones they prefer to worship sooner (also guessing which ones may be of interest for the opponents and which ones are safer to skip as they will not be chosen until later) and when it is better to get a smaller benefit following the priest of another player rather than saving a priest to get a greater boon but in a field that may not interest them as much (sort of quality over quantity).The resources your city produces (worshipping the correct deities) can be spent (worshipping other deities) to create buildings giving a variety of effects (and VPs), thus offering a lot of different strategic approaches to the game. Victory can be achieved with a plethora of buildings but also with very few ones. There are 45 different buildings: 33 can be built by anyone (even if someone else already did), while the other 12 are unique as only one copy of each can exist (introducing another element of contention between the players). You can also wage war to steal the resources of the other cities (if they were so foolish to keep their warehouses full and their military underdeveloped, it's just what they deserve) or invoke a terrible plague to decimate their population.All the actions (development, production, building, war, scoring, etc.) are done by worshipping the proper deity (and some gods give you a choice like ""do you develop your grain productivity – thus receiving more grain the next time you will produce it – or do you produce it now even if you won't get much?"", adding crucial tactical decisions to the game).When all the priests have been used, there's a brief upkeep to check some simple conditions (e.g., players with more than five unused resources must discard those in excess) and then a new turn begins (all priests return home and all deities can be worshipped again).Being the first to reach the maximum value in a certain field (e.g. culture 10) gives you an award worth two VPs. When four of these awards are claimed, the game ends. Each player receives bonus points based on how developed his city is and the highest score wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-5Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Ancient, City Building, Civilization, MythologyMechanisme: Take That, Variable Phase Order, Worker PlacementMakersOntwerper: Andrea Chiarvesio, Luca Iennaco]]>","boardgames","50","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/736-olympus.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/16060-home_default/olympus.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/736-olympus.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","50","8033772890243","FFST08-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1376.000000}"

The old machines are rusted and broken and the scavengers of Gearworld live off scraps from the past and refuse from the Sky People's flying cities. The scavengers' only hope for a better life is to build great towering skyworks and gain the favor of the World Above, allowing them to outlast and outlive their rival scavenger gangs. In the Borderlands, survival is an exception.Gearworld: The Borderlands is a game of conquest and survival in a post-apocalyptic world for 2-4 players who must gather resources and use them wisely. Players need those resources in order to strengthen their military might, to enhance their transport capabilities, and to reach the final goal of building the skyworks. Resources can be produced in areas with resource tokens, traded with other players, and taken by force. To build a development – e.g., weapons, transport vehicles or skyworks – all of the required resources have to be located in the same space on the map. This makes effective transport an important issue in the game. At the same time players must be strong enough to protect their resources from the other players while investing resources in their skyworks in order to win the game.Seize territory, marshal resources and defend yourself from your rivals.

Based on the best-selling A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones is an epic board game in which it will take more than military might to win. Will you take power through force, use honeyed words to coerce your way onto the throne, or rally the townsfolk to your side? Through strategic planning, masterful diplomacy, and clever card play, spread your influence over Westeros!To begin the game, each player receives an army of Footman, Knight, Siege Engine, and Ship units, as well as a set of Order tokens and other necessary components. Each player also receives a deck of unique House Cards, which are used as leaders in battles against rival Houses.Each round in the game is made up of three phases: the Westeros Phase, the Planning Phase, and the Action Phase. The Westeros Phase represents special events and day-to-day activities in Westeros. There are three different Westeros Decks, and each denotes a different global action, potentially affecting all players.The Planning Phase is perhaps the most important. Here you secretly assign orders to all of your units by placing one order token face down on each area you control that contains at least one unit (Knight, Footman, Ship, or Siege Engine). This portion of the game emphasizes diplomacy and deduction. Can you trust the alliance that you made? Will you betray your ally and march upon him? Players may make promises to each other (for aid or peace, for example), but these promises are never binding. The result is tense and compelling negotiations, often ending in backstabbing worthy of Westeros!During the Action Phase, the orders are resolved and battle is entered! When armies meet in combat, they secretly choose one of their House cards to add strength to the battle. Finally, the Houses can consolidate their power in the areas they control and use that power in future turns to influence their position in the court of the Iron Throne and to stand against the wildling Hordes.In addition to featuring updated graphics and a clarified ruleset, this second edition of A Game of Thrones includes elements from the A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords expansions, including ports, garrisons, Wildling cards, and Siege engines, while introducing welcome new innovations like player screens and Tides of Battle cards.Tides of Battle cards are an optional mechanism that brings an element of unpredictability to combat, representing erratic shifts in the momentum of war due to factors such as weather, morale, and tactical opportunity. During each combat, both players draw one Tides of Battle card from a communal deck, and its value modifies the strength of his chosen House card. What's more, such a card may also contain icons that can affect the outcome of the battle...all of which delivers a new level of intensity to your military engagements.Expanded by:     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) - A Dance with Dragons (2012)     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) - A Feast for Crows (2013)     A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition) - Mother of Dragons (2018)Reimplements:     A Game of Thrones (2003)     A Game of Thrones: A Clash of Kings Expansion (2004)     A Game of Thrones: A Storm of Swords Expansion (2006)AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 120 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Bluffing, Fantasy, Negotiation, Novel-based, Political, WargameMechanisme: Advantage Token, Alliances, Area Movement, Auction/Bidding, Auction: Sealed Bid, Card Play Conflict Resolution, Events, Hand Management, Income, Negotiation, Order Counters, Prisoner's Dilemma, Race, Simultaneous Action Selection, Sudden Death Ending, Turn Order: Auction, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Christian T.

The players explore the islands of South America, secure trading routes, and build settlements.The actions available to players are determined through the use of a specialized cube tower, which has appeared in the Queen titles Im Zeichen des Kreuzes and Wallenstein. At the start of the game, this tower is seeded with action cubes, which come in seven colors, with each color matching a particular type of action. During the game players will drop additional action cubes into the tower  but some of these cubes might get stuck in the floors of the tower while other cubes already in the tower are knocked free. Thus, players need to play both tactically  taking advantage of the actions currently available in the best way possible  and strategically  using their knowledge of which actions do what to play well over the course of the game.The game board is composed of nine, twelve or sixteen tiles, depending on the number of players. Players sail their ships through the landscape created for this game, landing on islands to plan and build settlements, which then supply resources and allow the player to earn victory points.

The castle would be a dangerous place with Vanestra's minions in control, but now countless other terrors also await heroes who are but the size of figs. Play as nimble Prince Collin and fence your way past your foes, or try Nez Bellows, the burly smith.

Every player will have a vital role in the quest to warn the king, and it will take careful planning to find Vanestra's weakness and defeat her.Mice and Mystics is a cooperative adventure game in which the players work together to save an imperiled kingdom. They will face countless adversaries such as rats, cockroaches, and spiders, and of course the greatest of all horrors: the castle's housecat, Brodie. Mice and Mystics is a boldly innovative game that thrusts players into an ever-changing, interactive environment, and features a rich storyline that the players help create as they play the game. The Cheese System allows players to hoard the crumbs of precious cheese they find on their journey, and use it to bolster their mice with grandiose new abilities and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds.Mice and Mystics will provide any group of friends with an unforgettable adventure they will be talking about for years to come – assuming they can all squeak by...Expansion advice:For those who have expansions for this game the recommended order by the game designer for playing them is as follows (see original post HERE):        Sorrow and Remembrance (Base game)        Cat's Cradle (Lost Chapter 1)        Heart of Glorm        The Ghost of Castle Andon (Lost Chapter 2)        Downwood Tales        Portents of Importance (Lost Chapter 3), connected to the story in Tail Feathers    AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Animals, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, MiniaturesMechanisme: Area Movement, Cooperative Game, Dice Rolling, Multiple Maps, Role Playing, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Storytelling, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Jerry Hawthorne]]>","boardgames","78.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/1598-mice-mystics.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/16708-home_default/mice-mystics.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/1598-mice-mystics.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","78.95","681706110004","[ib]PHG MM01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#600.000000}"

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go ""into decline"". A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy.

Fortunately for them, children always find unexpected allies and manage to escape her. Will you prove as fortunate?In Baba Yaga, you need to escape the claws of the hideous Baba Yaga. To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on. The first player to complete her three spells wins!Baba Yaga includes variants for younger players, more experienced players, and those who want the chicken-legged house to be constantly on the move. In the two-player game, the single opponent does all the moving of Baba Yaga, but must swap hands with each move, keeping the inactive hand on her head.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 6+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Children's Game, Memory, Novel-based, Party Game, Real-timeMechanisme: Memory, Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Jérémie Caplanne]]>","boardgames","25","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2376-baba-yaga.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/17379-home_default/baba-yaga.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2376-baba-yaga.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","25","3760175511134","IELBY","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#573.000000}"

The old sultan just died and control of Naqala is up for grabs! The oracles foretold of strangers who would maneuver the Five Tribes to gain influence over the legendary city-state. Will you fulfill the prophecy? Invoke the old Djinns and move the Tribes into position at the right time, and the Sultanate may become yours!Designed by Bruno Cathala, Five Tribes builds on a long tradition of German-style games that feature wooden meeples. Here, in a unique twist on the now-standard ""worker placement"" genre, the game begins with the meeples already in place – and players must cleverly maneuver them over the villages, markets, oases, and sacred places tiles that make up Naqala. How, when, and where you dis-place these Five Tribes of Assassins, Elders, Builders, Merchants, and Viziers determine your victory or failure.As befitting a Days of Wonder game, the rules are straightforward and easy to learn. But devising a winning strategy will take a more calculated approach than our standard fare. You need to carefully consider what moves can score you well and put your opponents at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory, including the summoning of powerful Djinns that may help your cause as you attempt to control this legendary Sultanate.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 40 min.Leeftijd: 13+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Arabian, Fantasy, MythologyMechanisme: Auction/Bidding, Constrained Bidding, End Game Bonuses, Hidden Victory Points, Mancala, Modular Board, Set Collection, Square Grid, Take That, Turn Order: Auction, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-up, Victory Points as a ResourceMakersOntwerper: Bruno Cathala]]>","boardgames","67.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2614-five-tribes-the-djinns-of-naqale.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/17634-home_default/five-tribes-the-djinns-of-naqale.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2614-five-tribes-the-djinns-of-naqale.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","67.95","824968784914","DOW 8401","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1716.000000}"

Maybe it's the lights, maybe it's the energy, or maybe it's the giant monsters trying to demolish the place!King of New York is a standalone game from designer Richard Garfield that keeps the core ideas of King of Tokyo while introducing new ways to play. As in KoT, your goal is to be the first monster to collect 20 victory points (VPs) or to be the last monster standing. On your turn, you roll six dice up to three times, then carry out the actions on those dice. Claws cause damage to other monsters, hearts heal damage to yourself, and energy is stored up so that you can purchase power cards that provide unique effects not available to anyone else.What's new in King of New York is that you can now try to become a star in the big city; more specifically, you can achieve ""Fame"", which nets you VPs, but superstar status is fleeting, so enjoy your time in the spotlight.The game board for King of New York is larger than in KoT with each monster occupying a district in the city and everyone trying to shine in Manhattan. When you attack, you can displace a monster in another district, whether to escape military forces or to find new smashing opportunities. Yes, smashing because you can now destroy buildings and get bonuses for doing so, but the more destruction you cause, the more intense the military response.The monsters from King of New York can be used in KoT and vice versa, but the power cards are specific to this game.Part of the King of Tokyo series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 40 min.Leeftijd: 10+Soort spelType/Thema: Dice, Fighting, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science FictionMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Die Icon Resolution, King of the Hill, Open Drafting, Player Elimination, Push Your Luck, Re-rolling and Locking, Tags, Take ThatMakersOntwerper: Richard Garfield]]>","boardgames","43.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2647-king-of-new-york.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/17650-home_default/king-of-new-york.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2647-king-of-new-york.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","43.95","3760175511707","IEL51170","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1060.000000}"

Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops—all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.
On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card—in order to make sure you get it, or, why not, your opponents don't get it—you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.
All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.

In this game, you and your friends can participate in two separate games. The campaign game pits the limitless troops and resources of the Galactic Empire against a crack team of elite Rebel operatives as they strive to break the Empires hold on the galaxy, while the skirmish game invites you and a friend to muster strike teams and battle head-to-head over conflicting objectives.In the campaign game, Imperial Assault invites you to play through a cinematic tale set in the Star Wars universe. One player commands the seemingly limitless armies of the Galactic Empire, threatening to extinguish the flame of the Rebellion forever. Up to four other players become heroes of the Rebel Alliance, engaging in covert operations to undermine the Empires schemes. Over the course of the campaign, both the Imperial player and the Rebel heroes gain new experience and skills, allowing characters to evolve as the story unfolds.Imperial Assault offers a different game experience in the skirmish game. In skirmish missions, you and a friend compete in head-to-head, tactical combat. Youll gather your own strike force of Imperials, Rebels, and Mercenaries and build a deck of command cards to gain an unexpected advantage in the heat of battle.

The sought-after gemstones can be found around the mining town of Diamantina. They can be bought and sold at the gem exchange, shady traders are always willing to engage in a little wheeling and dealing, and then you can use the gems to claim valuable mining rights, artifacts and jewellery. Who will become the most successful gem trading mogul?Zavandor is a fantasy setting which revolves around a capitalist economy based on trading in gems - sapphires, rubies, mystical gems etc. Other games in the family include Mines of Zavandor, and The Scepter of Zavandor.Gnomes of Zavandor features two central boards. The first is a grid with markers indicating the current price of each of the gem types, and also indicating whether the price is going to go up or down next turn. Gems can be bought (or sold) for cash in the first phase of each turn. Buying gems makes them more valuable in subsequent turns; selling them reduces their value, and this is reflected on the grid. These gems can be used to buy tiles from the second board, a star-shaped arena featuring ""mining rights"" tiles positioned randomly around it. The position on the board indicates the cost to purchase these mining rights; the cost will be a mixed selection of coloured gems. At the end of each turn, players gain new gems according to the mining rights they have acquired and this affects the central economy, generally reducing the value of the relevant gems when they are purchased for hard cash, in future rounds.The initial phase of the turn involves buying gems, selling gems, taking gold, trading with the central supply, and purchasing cards and tokens (with gems rather than cash). The items available for purchase include equipment improving your efficiency, jewels providing victory points, and mining rights. The second phase of the turn involves mining for new gems. Each player takes the gems they are allowed according to their mining rights. At the end of each turn, the market values are adjusted according to the actions which have occurred; the price of the available equipment is discounted (this rule is optional); and another area of the star-shaped board becomes accessible with more mining-rights available to purchase in the next round.The game continues until one player has reached a victory-point target, dependent on the number of players in the game. Victory points are achieved by purchasing mining-rights, equipment, and most significantly (but also most expensively) jewellery.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Economic, FantasyMechanisme: Commodity Speculation, Memory, Modular Board, Open Drafting, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Torsten Landsvogt]]>","boardgames","25","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2890-the-gnomes-of-zavandor.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/17909-home_default/the-gnomes-of-zavandor.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2890-the-gnomes-of-zavandor.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","25","681706070902","ZMG-7090","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#772.000000}"

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points.

First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game.Second, every route  whether double or single  has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll  which costs 1-4 coins  to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game.In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often.These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points.]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2921-ticket-to-ride-nederland.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/17932-home_default/ticket-to-ride-nederland.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/2921-ticket-to-ride-nederland.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","29.95","824968817766","DOW-720120","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1132.000000}"

Idle under miles of water, it fell asleep dreaming of the day when its time would come once again.In Night of the Grand Octopus, you are one of the Elect and have been recruited by the Illuminati to form a cult to glorify the tentacled one. What's more, your dreams have told you that the time has come, the stars have aligned so that you can perform the ""Ritual of Appeal"" and bring the Grand Octopus to surface once again. To perform the ritual, however, you need the right magical components, components to be found in a famous English university for young wizards and witches — and you're not the only one seeking them.In each round, players secretly place their cultist and monster tokens on locations, then reveal those locations at the same time. If only one cultist group occupies a location, that cult gains strength — but if two or more cults want the same spot, they must negotiate or both lose cult strength. If, on the other hand, a rival monster occupies the location, the cultist is eliminated.

The expansion comes with one pre-painted miniature CR90 corvette, one command dial, all requisite tokens, and ship cards for both the CR90a and CR90b configurations.

In this game, players take turns playing the part of the industrious ants and the grasshopper content to sponge off the labor of the ants.The Grasshopper  the Ant includes two ways to play, but the heart of both is the same. At the start of the game, lay out 16 (of the 48) path cards in a 4x4 grid; each path card shows one of four types of landscapes. The ant player places six ants on these cards, one ant per card, with the ants forming a chain (as in real life), then secretly chooses one type of terrain on which at least one ant stands. The grasshopper player then stands with one of the ants, and if the grasshopper chose the same landscape as the ant player, the grasshopper takes all the path cards of this type on which an ant stands; if the grasshopper chose incorrectly, then the ant player takes these path cards. Either way, you then refill the 4x4 grid. The ant player keeps playing until she finally wins path cards, then the next player in clockwise order controls the ants. (In winter mode, the third and fourth players control red ants and receive a random path card if they match the choice of the ant player.)In autumn mode, players score path cards immediately, with each type being tracked independently; path cards that feature insects are saved for a endgame bonus. As soon as a player maxes out two scoring tracks, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.In winter mode, players keep the path cards they collect in order to buy provision cards (worth one victory point), which cost particular combinations of path types. In this mode, when you win a path card that features an insect, you can claim another card in the grid that features the same insect. Collect both provision cards of the same type, and you score a bonus VP. The first player to collect 4 VPs wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Soort spelType/Thema: Animals, Bluffing, Novel-basedMechanisme: Set Collection, Stock HoldingMakersOntwerper: Yoann Levet]]>","boardgames","24.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3046-the-grasshopper-and-the-ant.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/18068-home_default/the-grasshopper-and-the-ant.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3046-the-grasshopper-and-the-ant.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","24.95","3760175512186","IEL1218","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#500.000000}"

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Soort spelType/Thema: Bluffing, Card Game, Fantasy, FightingMechanisme: Betting and Bluffing, Memory, Player Elimination, Push Your LuckMakersOntwerper: Hisanori Hiraoka, Masato Uesugi]]>","boardgames","15.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3280-welcome-to-the-dungeon.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/18299-home_default/welcome-to-the-dungeon.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3280-welcome-to-the-dungeon.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","15.95","3760175512346","IEL51234","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#268.000000}"

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn.

As temporal agents, you and your team will be sent into the bodies of beings from different worlds or realities to successfully complete the missions given to you. Failure is impossible, as you will be able to go back in time as many times as required.T.I.M.E Stories is a narrative game, a game of ""decksploration"". Each player is free to give their character as deep a ""role"" as they want, in order to live through a story, as much in the game as around the table. But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the number of players. Each attempt is called a ""run""; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario’s obstacles.You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time.The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which — Asylum — is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers. An insert allows players to ""save"" the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game. This way, it's possible to pause your ongoing game by preserving the state of the receptacles, the remaining TU, the discovered clues, etc.--description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 90 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Arabian, Puzzle, Science FictionMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Dice Rolling, Move Through Deck, Narrative Choice / Paragraph, Storytelling, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Peggy Chassenet, Manuel Rozoy]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3615-time-stories.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27249-home_default/time-stories.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3615-time-stories.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Space Cowboys]]","49.95","3558380031000","AMDTIS01-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1805.000000}"
"07d1b617-4a62-420c-a289-7b85378c8000","<![CDATA[Mysterium NL]]","<![CDATA[In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary sance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards  one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon  then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.Part of the Pandemic seriesAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 13+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Environmental, MedicalMechanisme: Action Points, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Legacy Game, Point to Point Movement, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Set Collection, Tags, Trading, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Rob Daviau, Matt Leacock]]>","boardgames","82.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3619-pandemic-legacy-season-1-blue.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/18678-home_default/pandemic-legacy-season-1-blue.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3619-pandemic-legacy-season-1-blue.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","82.95","681706711706","ZMG71170","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2100.000000}"

Each time that a player completes a route, they claim a share of one of the companies depicted next to that route. At the end of the game, whoever holds more shares of a company than all other players receives points as a reward.The United Kingdom half of this map collection introduces the concept of technology to TtR. At the start of the game, players can build only one- and two-train routes and only in England. By spending wild cards, players gain the ability to build routes three trains long or longer, in addition to being able to build ferries across water and build train routes in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Players can also buy bonus cards that allow them to score extra points for taking certain actions during play. The game takes us to the beginning of the railway era, so the title correct for the whole United Kingdom of Great Britan and Ireland. Take notice: Designer Alan R. Moon has himself mentioned in his Design Diary of the game that The Advanced Technology Cards were not fully playtested. He also doubled down on that sentiment in the rules forum with I've seen several posts where players are playing with the Advanced Technologies the first time they play the game. These cards were included because we had extra cards that could be used for them, and we considered including them as a bonus, but they were never intended to be part of the basic game..Although officially an expansion for Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe, this could be used for Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries.  However use with Nordic Countries would be limited to three players and use of spare trains.

"8a478a08-6f4b-428e-b589-d9831c9d8afe","<![CDATA[Mysterium EN]]","<![CDATA[In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologer, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary séance, and they have seven hours to make contact with the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.Unable to talk, the amnesiac ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group. The ghost then selects one group, places the matching culprit number face down on the epilogue board, picks three vision cards — one for the suspect, one for the location, and one for the weapon — then shuffles these cards. Players who have achieved few clairvoyancy points flip over one vision card at random, then secretly vote on which suspect they think is guilty; players with more points then flip over a second vision card and vote; then those with the most points see the final card and vote.If a majority of the mediums have identified the proper suspect, with ties being broken by the vote of the most clairvoyant medium, then the killer has been identified and the ghost can now rest peacefully.

This side board expansion opens up six new locations throughout Egypt, including bustling Cairo, ancient Tel El-Amarna, and the shining, snaking, Nile River. Yet the Egypt of the 1920s is hardly a safe tourist destination. Amid the cultural tumult and political instability of this modernizing African nation, countless Cultists are working to bring about the return of an ancient and powerful evil known as the Dark Pharaoh. If he should rise up to rule Egypt once more with his iron will, he would doom all humankind to wretched, cruel slavery.Fighting this battle against terrible evil are eight more investigators, aided by invaluable Relics, powerful Glamour spells, and legendary allies.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.Part of the Pandemic seriesAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 13+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Environmental, MedicalMechanisme: Action Points, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Legacy Game, Point to Point Movement, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Set Collection, Tags, Trading, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Rob Daviau, Matt Leacock]]>","boardgames","82.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3999-pandemic-legacy-season-1-red.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27143-home_default/pandemic-legacy-season-1-red.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/3999-pandemic-legacy-season-1-red.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","82.95","681706711713","ZMG71171","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2100.000000}"

(""Simply Ingenious: Whoever Risks Too Much Loses!"") is a tile game related to the Ingenious board game in that players are once again collecting as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also needing to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well.To start the game, mix all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) face down, then turn three face up and place them in a shared pool in the center of the table. On a turn, a player flips a tile face up. If the tile doesn't match one of those in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can either end his turn and collect the face-up tiles before him and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn.If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. (With four players, the goal is five tiles.) Any tiles of a color you collect over seven are shuffled back into the supply.If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool.

"41f27873-4029-46fb-98f4-f93d2ce57d65","<![CDATA[Star Wars Rebellion]]","<![CDATA[Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players.Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 180 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Civil War, Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, WargameMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Area Movement, Area-Impulse, Card Play Conflict Resolution, Contracts, Delayed Purchase, Dice Rolling, Die Icon Resolution, Events, Hand Management, Hidden Movement, Income, Once-Per-Game Abilities, Tags, Take That, Team-Based Game, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-up, Worker Placement, Different Worker TypesMakersOntwerper: Corey Konieczka]]>","boardgames","110.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4165-star-wars-rebellion.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27215-home_default/star-wars-rebellion.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4165-star-wars-rebellion.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","110.95","841333101053","[ib]FFSW03","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2790.000000}"

Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets – goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.""The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket – each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,"" says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. ""The tension comes from being forced to balance greed – adding more cards to your hand, and fear – losing a critical route to a competitor.""Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a ""gateway game"" -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.Part of the Ticket to Ride series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: TrainsMechanisme: Connections, Contracts, End Game Bonuses, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Push Your Luck, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alan R.

From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete, new game and does not require the original version.More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponent's route to connect yours. The game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces.The overall goal remains the same: collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.Copyright 2002-2014 Days of Wonder, inc.Part of the Ticket to Ride series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: TrainsMechanisme: Connections, Contracts, End Game Bonuses, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Push Your Luck, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alan R.

At the start of play, each player places their pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes  that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.2015 edition:The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem. Whoever scores the most gem-points after nine rounds wins the game.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 25 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Puzzle, Real-timeMechanisme: Grid Coverage, Pattern Building, Real-Time, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Grzegorz Rejchtman]]>","boardgames","34.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4226-ubongo.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/19307-home_default/ubongo.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4226-ubongo.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","34.95","8718026301699","WGG1518","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1341.000000}"

Each player can place whatever sum is rolled into an empty shape in a row that matches the color of one of the dice. Two rules must be followed when placing a sum in a row:    All numbers in a row must increase from left to right.    No number can be repeated in a vertical column.A player does not have to enter the number in a row, but if the active player, the one who rolled the dice, doesn't do so, then they must mark a misthrow box on their scoresheet.The game continues until someone has filled two rows on their scoresheet or someone has tallied four misthrows. Players then tally their points: For each completed column on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the number in that column's pentagon. For each completed row on their scoresheet, a player scores points equal to the rightmost number in that row. For each incomplete row on their scoresheet, a player scores one point per number in that row. For each misthrow, a player loses five points.

Strange is the night where black stars rise,And strange moons circle through the skiesBut stranger still isLost Carcosa.–Cassilda’s Song in The King in Yellow, Act I, Scene 2
Beneath the light of a gibbous moon, poets and artists pen strange verse and weave arcane sigils into their paintings. The Unspeakable One is entering the world, his horrid city is tearing its way through dimensions, and as it does so, more and more humans succumb to a mindless insanity. The very people you have sworn to protect may come padding after you on a cursed night, knife in hand and the light of evil stars gleaming in their eyes. Whether you’re walking along the streets of Tokyo or through trackless jungles in the heart of Africa, you may be forced to choose between the people close to you and the people of the world.
Signs of Carcosa is a new expansion for Eldritch Horror, and within, you’ll find enough madness to influence all of your games. Hastur enters the game as a new Ancient One, spreading insanity and dissension. Against this foul abomination from Aldebaran, four new investigators join the fight to save the world. A host of new Encounter cards for every continent ensure that fresh adventures are always around the corner, even as a wealth of new conditions, spells, assets, artifacts, and Mythos cards draw you deeper into a world of madness and fear.

Red and the pigs are in danger of being eaten! Rather than surrender to the plate, though, they decide to trap the wolf and shoo him from the village. Can they drive the wolf away – or will they all be eaten?In Eat Me, If You Can, the wolf player tries to eat one of the other players to score points while the players, being prey, score by trapping the wolf. In each round, one player is the wolf and the other players are given Little Red Riding Hood (worth 3 points), Mother Pig (2 points), or a little piggy (1 point). Each non-wolf player then secretly chooses one of two cards in hand: Will the player sleep and rest, hoping not to be disturbed by the wolf? Or will the player set up a trap, thinking that the wolf will be coming for her? Once the players lay down their cards, the wolf chooses one of the players. If this player went to sleep, the wolf takes points from this player equal to the value of her character; if she set up a trap, on the other hand, she takes points from the wolf. Everyone else who rested this round scores points from the bank for their character — but only if they got their beauty sleep!Whoever lost points that round becomes the wolf for the next round and hands out the character cards to players as she wishes. As soon as a player has ten or more points, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 10 min.Leeftijd: 6+Soort spelType/Thema: Bluffing, DeductionMechanisme: Push Your LuckMakersOntwerper: Jun'ichi Sato]]>","boardgames","15","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4506-eat-me-if-you-can.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/19593-home_default/eat-me-if-you-can.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4506-eat-me-if-you-can.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","15","3760175511882","IEL51188","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#204.000000}"

Moon – Four or six players compete as two-player teams, with teammates sitting next to one another at the table. Each player has their own secret hand of cards and tickets, in addition to some cards and tickets being placed in a shared cardholder that either player on the team can access.When a player draws cards, they must place one card in the cardholder and the other in their hand (unless she takes a face-up locomotive, in which case it must be shared); when a player draws tickets, the first ticket kept must be placed in the cardholder and any additional tickets kept added to their hand. A player can spend their turn to add two tickets from their hand to the cardholder. A team's points are tracked collectively, and the team with the highest score wins.• Legendary Asia from François Valentyne – The main change in this set-up is that some of the routes through Asia are labeled mountain routes, with one or more spaces on the route bearing an X.

Your neighbor or your family member may secretly serve the ISB. The man you pass on your way to work or the talkative woman in the cantina could be an informer. You cant trust anyone, and in this atmosphere of stifling fear, few dare to speak of rebellion. Now, you can enforce the status quo and punish sedition in your games of Imperial Assault with the help of the ISB Infiltrators Villain Pack.If the heroes are unlucky enough to encounter them on a mission, the ISB Infiltrators prove to be dangerous combatants, using the new Hidden condition to reduce enemy accuracy and gaining surges to deal more damage and increase accuracy. More than that, each ISB Infiltrator benefits from the Coordinated Raid ability, which allows another figure in the group to interrupt and perform an attack. Obviously, more attacks can significantly increase your damage output over the course of the game.Whether youre using their unique talents in a campaign or a skirmish, this Villain Pack offers additional cards and missions to supplement your adventures in the Star Wars galaxy. A new Agenda set, Command cards, Reward cards, and a skirmish upgrade offer you additional tools for any mission, from the ISBs vaunted training grounds to an Imperial facility on Bespin.]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4627-star-wars-imperial-assault-isb-infiltrators-villain-pack.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/19684-home_default/star-wars-imperial-assault-isb-infiltrators-villain-pack.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4627-star-wars-imperial-assault-isb-infiltrators-villain-pack.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","19.95","841333101176","[ib]FFSWI28","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#88.000000}"

A number of bonus buttons, which have 1-4 holes, are stacked on the table, again based on the number of players. Going clockwise around the table, each player (after the first) places one loop on the table so that it surrounds exactly one spool, then draws a word tag from the box and attaches it to this loop, then places one spool in one section of loop(s) that has no spool in it. (Think of a Venn diagram; two overlapping circles form three sections, with one section having both circles in common and two sections being part of only one circle.)Once all of the spools have been placed, everyone races to think of words, names, or phrases for each spool based on the word tags associated with that spool. If a spool has three loops around it, for example, it has three words associated with it, and your answer must relate to those words in some manner.As soon as someone has finished or can't think of more answers, they grab the topmost button on the stack (the one with the most holes). Once the final button is grabbed, players can't write more answers. Players then compare answers, crossing out those they have in common with someone else, then scoring points for the remaining answers; each answer is worth as many points as the number of loops around the spool with the same number. Buttons are worth as many points as the number of holes they have, and whoever has the highest score wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-8Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Word GameMechanisme: Enclosure, Paper-and-PencilMakersOntwerper: Matt Leacock]]>","boardgames","32","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4628-knit-wit.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26758-home_default/knit-wit.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/4628-knit-wit.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","32","681706716503","ZMG71650","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#748.000000}"

"a759aeac-2c69-4892-8ccc-b512c2e1dec3","<![CDATA[Diamant]]","<![CDATA[Diamant  also published as Incan Gold  is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper  but at the risk of ending up with nothing.All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-8Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Soort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Bluffing, ExplorationMechanisme: Move Through Deck, Push Your Luck, Score-and-Reset Game, Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Bruno Faidutti, Alan R.

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.Part of Ticket to Ride series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Soort spelType/Thema: TrainsMechanisme: Connections, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alan R.

Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground.

You are reliving the cultural achievements, mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today — a term that was used quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls caused great distress.In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.--gameplay description from @StoryBoardGamer's review:A Feast for Odin is a points-driven game, with plethora of pathways to victory, with a range of risk balanced against reward. A significant portion of this is your central hall, which has a whopping -86 points of squares and a major part of your game is attempting to cover these up with various tiles. Likewise, long halls and island colonies can also offer large rewards, but they will have penalties of their own.Each year follows a familiar pattern of preparation, worker placement, and then meeting the requirements of your feast. The main phase of each year is a worker placement affair. You start with a selection of Vikings, and a large action board with a whopping 61 different options to choose from. Each of these will be arranged from left to right in one of four columns. Each column requires an additional Viking to activate, but they are proportionally more powerful.At the end of each round, you will need to fill a feast table with food, alternating between plants and vegetable matter. You will also have a chance to lay the valuable green and blue tiles into your main hall. The configuration of these tiles must follow certain requirements, but your main goal is to both cover up a line of coin icons to increase your income, while otherwise encircling certain printed icons to generate those.You will build your engine over time, following an alternating pattern of outward expansion and hunting against development and cultivation. It all comes down to how much you’re willing to take on at any one time, and what risks you’re willing to set yourself up with for their rewards.UPC 681706716909AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Economic, Farming, Industry / Manufacturing, Medieval, PuzzleMechanisme: Automatic Resource Growth, Dice Rolling, Grid Coverage, Income, Push Your Luck, Solo / Solitaire Game, Tile Placement, Turn Order: Pass Order, Worker PlacementMakersOntwerper: Uwe Rosenberg]]>","boardgames","89.95","0","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5020-odin.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/20077-home_default/odin.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5020-odin.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","89.95","8718026301989","WGG1621","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#3428.000000}"

"c5a86a15-34b1-48f9-a085-f4d47c6453e5","<![CDATA[Escape: The Curse of the Temple]]","<![CDATA[Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile  the safe room  and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:    A cursed mask  this die is set aside when rolled.    A golden mask  each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.    A red torch or blue key  these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die  you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you discover magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the Treasures module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the Curses module, some tiles curse players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 10 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Action / Dexterity, Adventure, Dice, Electronic, Exploration, Real-timeMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Dice Rolling, Elapsed Real Time Ending, Grid Movement, Modular Board, Physical Removal, Push Your Luck, Re-rolling and Locking, Real-Time, Roll / Spin and Move, Solo / Solitaire Game, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Kristian Amundsen Østby]]>","boardgames","42.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5094-escape-the-curse-of-the-temple.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/20151-home_default/escape-the-curse-of-the-temple.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5094-escape-the-curse-of-the-temple.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","42.95","4010350609019","QNG60901","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1744.000000}"

They also take three stall cards (which highlight one or more sections on the game board) and one coin of each of the six colors. Five colored customers start at particular locations on the game board, with the sixth customer placed to the side. On a turn, a player either:    Draws two cards (face-up or face-down stall cards or market barker cards).    Moves a customer to a stall of that customer's color.    Plays a stall card; then builds a new stall, expands an existing stall, or moves a blocked-off stall.The active player can choose to move any customer, and that customer will move to the closest stall (measured on orthogonal paths) of the same color. Additionally, this player can choose to play one or more market barker cards to call the customer past one or more stalls, presumably to bring the customer to that player's own stall. If the active player owns the visited stall, he receives one coin of the stall's color for each tile in that stall; if not, the active player receives a one coin commission while the owner receives the normal payout. This customer is then swapped with the customer off the board.When building a new stall, a player cannot place it in the same region as another stall of the same color. Regulations! Restaurants must be placed in an area designated for them, while all other stalls must go in the market area. When expanding an existing stall, the player must pay one coin of the same color for each tile in the enlarged stall. By expanding, you can earn more coins when customers visit, create longer paths to opponents' stalls, reserve area in which to expand further, and (most importantly) earn victory points. You score VPs each time you expand, and if your stall is the largest (or tied for the largest) of that color, you'll take one or two medals that provide a VP bonus.Once the expansions run low in one or two colors, players can only build or expand. Once everyone has finished building, the game ends, with players earning VPs for the medals and money they have in hand.

Crime is the closest thing to government that Tatooine has, and all crime on Tatooine feeds back to Jabba the Hutt. Jabba has spent decades establishing his criminal empire and crushing all competitors. Now, he can help guide your mercenaries' strike team to victory with the Jabba the Hutt Villain Pack.Three new Agenda cards invite you to spread the might of Jabba the Hutt across the Star Wars galaxy, even when the Rebel heroes venture beyond Tatooine itself.

Vaccarino's Kingdom Builder, with four new game boards - and consequently four new powers associated with their respective game boards, such as the power to place one or two stones from a quarry on empty spaces to block them. Three additional Kingdom Builder scoring cards are included to provide new scoring opportunities during game play, and red houses are included to allow for up to five to play.The new game boards replace the castle spaces from the base game (which score three points for anyone adjacent to them) with nomad spaces. During set-up, in which four game boards are chosen at random from all available boards, a randomly chosen nomad tile is placed on each nomad space. The first player to build a settlement adjacent to a nomad space takes this tile and must use it during her next turn; the tile is removed from the game after her next turn, whether she used it or not. Nomad tiles allow a player to build three settlements on the specified terrain, move settlements, build without following the adjacency rule, remove another player's settlement, or score points.The new scoring cards give points as you place settlements during your turn, specifically for placing settlements in a straight line, for placing settlements next to those of other players, and for placing settlements on terrain that's not adjacent to empty terrain of the same type. (Replacement scoring cards for Workers and Merchants are included in Kingdom Builder: Nomads and should be used in place of those in the base game. These cards merely reflect the fact that the expansion boards have Nomad spaces which also count for scoring for these cards.)In addition to the quarry power  which both helps block opponents and fill spaces in which you don't want to place settlements  the new location powers allow you to place a settlement in the flower fields, to place a settlement adjacent to at least three of your own settlements, and to move a settlement in a straight line on the board until it hits an obstacle.Kingdom Builder: Nomads FAQ]]>","boardgames","25","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5269-kingdom-builder-nomads.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/20332-home_default/kingdom-builder-nomads.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5269-kingdom-builder-nomads.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","25","","QUE-0923","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1160.000000}"

This is the Gamewright version.1996 Mensa SelectRepublished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 ""Exchange"", 7 ""Spy"", and 5 ""2 X draw""). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the ""2X look"" card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 10 min.Leeftijd: 6+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Animals, Card Game, Children's Game, MemoryMechanisme: Memory, Open Drafting, Push Your Luck, Take ThatMakersOntwerper: Monty Stambler, Ann Stambler]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5468-beverbende-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26183-home_default/beverbende-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5468-beverbende-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8717249193050","999-BEV01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#180.000000}"

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck  unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the fields in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete  and all trades on a turn must involve the active player  then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the beanometer for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.The original German edition supports 3-5 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the Erweiterungs-Set, but also adapts the two-player rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-7Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Farming, NegotiationMechanisme: Hand Management, Negotiation, Set Collection, TradingMakersOntwerper: Uwe Rosenberg]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5483-boonanza-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26186-home_default/boonanza-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5483-boonanza-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8717249191506","999-BOO01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#220.000000}"

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: Is it really worth putting my last meeple there? or Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points? Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.First game in the Carcassonne series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: City Building, Medieval, Territory BuildingMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Map Addition, Pattern Recognition, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Klaus-Jürgen Wrede]]>","boardgames","34.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5502-carcassonne-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26199-home_default/carcassonne-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5502-carcassonne-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","34.95","8719214420659","999-CAR01N","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#790.000000}"

Dit handelsspel speelt zich af op een eiland waar zich de grondstoffen hout, erts, graan, baksteen en wol bevinden. De spelers beginnen het spel met twee dorpen, die grenzen aan tegels met deze grondstoffen. Het getal op de tegel geeft aan bij welke dobbelsteenworp wordt geoogst. Elk aangrenzend(e) dorp of stad ontvangt grondstoffen bij deze worp. Met deze grondstoffen kan worden gehandeld en gebouwd. Voor het bouwen van nieuwe starten, dorpen of steden wordt een bepaalde combinatie van grondstoffengevraagd, die men door slim handelen met de medespelers, of de zich op het bord bevindende havens kan verkrijgen. Je kunt ook nieuwe ontwikkelingen kopen.

This is an expansion for The Settlers of Catan. Players can build shipping lanes, which are very similar to roads. Additionally, the game comes with many different water-hex-heavy variant setups. The American version (Mayfair) should only be used with the American base game, instead of the German one (Kosmos), because of matching components and for the same reason, the Kosmos German version should only be used with the German base game. Additionally, several different editions exist; 5th edition is the most recent. Editions should only be used with same edition, otherwise the purchase of adapter kit is required.

This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper  Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Les Colons de Catane: Le jeu de ds.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: DiceMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Paper-and-Pencil, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Klaus Teuber]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5549-de-kolonisten-van-catan-het-dobbelspel-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26228-home_default/de-kolonisten-van-catan-het-dobbelspel-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5549-de-kolonisten-van-catan-het-dobbelspel-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8717249192619","999-KOL21","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#160.000000}"

Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the game.The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's developments making this version less luck dependent than the original. A twist in the game is that certain developments are limited and can be stolen from other players once there are no new ones left. The first player to gain 10 victory points, wins the game.(Note that Kosmos lists this game with a 30-minute playing time, while Mayfair Games sets the playing time at 45-60 minutes.)Mixing two copies of game, can be played with 5 and 6 players.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, City BuildingMechanisme: Hand Management, TradingMakersOntwerper: Klaus Teuber]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5552-de-kolonisten-van-catan-het-snelle-kaartspel-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26230-home_default/de-kolonisten-van-catan-het-snelle-kaartspel-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5552-de-kolonisten-van-catan-het-snelle-kaartspel-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8717249194347","999-KOL29","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#200.000000}"

First, instead of having only a single island in the game on which players build and compete for resources, three islands are present – but the landscape of only one of these islands is known at the start of the game. Players start on this island, then build ships and bring settlers into play so that they can then travel to new lands. When a ship ends its movement on unexplored territory, that hex is revealed and a randomly-drawn number chip placed on it, with the player earning one resource as a reward – assuming the hex produces resources, that is. (The number of unknown tiles varies from 16 to 32, depending on the scenario.) A settler and ship can be transformed into a port settlement, from which roads and new ships can be built to enable further exploration.Second, instead of using cities, Catan: Explorers  Pirates allows players to build port settlements for two corn and two ore, with a port settlement supplying one resource when the adjacent number is rolled at the start of a turn. Like cities, port settlements are worth two victory points (VPs), and the number of VPs required to win depends on the scenario.Third, if a player receives no resources during the production roll (other than on a roll of 7), she receives one gold in compensation. Two gold can be traded with the bank for a resource of the player's choice. Gold has other uses as well, such as helping you escape from pirates.The five scenarios included in Catan: Explorers  Pirates are:• Land Ho! Explore the seas of Catan and discover two new islands to expand your settlements. Once you've discovered an island, you must use ships to ferry settlers from one island to another and colonize distant lands. (Introductory scenario)• Pirate Lairs! In this scenario, pirates prowl the seas along with your trading vessels. Pay tribute to the pirates or drive them off, then find and capture their lairs to earn gold and VPs! (One mission scenario)• Fish for Catan! The people of Catan are short of food, so it's time to take to the ocean to fish for meals. These are deep water fish, though, so first you must find their shoals before you can catch them! The Council of Catan will reward players with VPs for returning fish to the island, as well as for capturing pirate lairs. Just watch out for roaming pirates, as not only will they demand gold for tribute, they might also get to the fish before you do! (Two mission scenario)• Spices for Catan! In this scenario, the Council of Catan wants you to find fish and spices for the people of Catan! As before, they reward the most industrious merchant captains with VPs. Obtaining spice will require you to become friends with the mysterious inhabitants of the Spice Islands, but in return they will not only trade you spices but teach you their knowledge of sailing or even pirate fighting techniques! (Two mission scenario)• Explorers and Pirates! This lengthy and challenging scenario brings everything from the previous scenarios together! Explore new lands, capture pirate lairs, find fish, and befriend the inhabitants of the spice isles! (Three mission scenario)]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5558-de-kolonisten-van-catan-piraten-en-ontdekkers-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26233-home_default/de-kolonisten-van-catan-piraten-en-ontdekkers-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5558-de-kolonisten-van-catan-piraten-en-ontdekkers-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","49.95","8720289472542","999-KOL32E","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1730.000000}"

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.Belongs to the Catan Series.The game changes the base game in three main ways:First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.]]>","boardgames","39.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5561-de-kolonisten-van-catan-steden-en-ridders-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26234-home_default/de-kolonisten-van-catan-steden-en-ridders-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5561-de-kolonisten-van-catan-steden-en-ridders-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","39.95","8720289472726","999-KOL05E","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#980.000000}"

To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps creatures on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.At the heart of Legends of Andor is its unique narrative, the linked scenarios of which tell an overarching story as the players successfully complete objectives. For each scenario, or Legend, a legend deck conveys the plot of an ever-unfolding tale...one in which the players are the protagonists. A wooden marker moves along the board's legend track at key points during each scenario, triggering the draw of a new legend card, the introduction of new game-altering effects, and the advancement of the story's plot. In the end, the players must endeavor to guide the fate of Andor through their heroic actions, bringing a happy ending to their epic fantasy tale.Will their heroes roam the land completing quests in the name of glory, or devote themselves to the defense of the realm?

The ravine is great; you get lots of sun, and you can just drop garbage wherever you want. In your free time you've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.Dominion: Dark Ages is the seventh addition to the game of Dominion. It contains 500 cards but is not a standalone game. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can get only via specific other cards. The central themes are the trash and upgrading. There are cards that do something when trashed, cards that care about the trash, cards that upgrade themselves, and ways to upgrade other cards.Part of the Dominion series.]]>","boardgames","42.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5583-dominion-de-donkere-middeleeuwen-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26254-home_default/dominion-de-donkere-middeleeuwen-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5583-dominion-de-donkere-middeleeuwen-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","42.95","8717249196754","999-DOM10","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1490.000000}"

The deck contains 56 playing cards showing four kinds of fruit in groups of 1 to 5 and a bell of the type found at hotel reception desks.The deck is distributed evenly between the players. All players hold their deck face down and take turns dealing one card face up in front of them. As each player reveals her next card, the instant you see a total of five of one kind of fruit on the table, hit the bell.

When two players are left, they play until the bell is struck once more, then the game ends and the taller deck wins.Keep in mind that a five-of-a-kind can occur both when cards are revealed and when they're covered.

Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (""cha cha"") by completing circuits around the yard.
Goal: To ""cha cha"" your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's ""tail feathers"" as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.
Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles. One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of ""pathway"" of egg tiles that is encircling the ""yard"" (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden ""tail feathers"" may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken ""ahead"" of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken ""behind"" it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.
Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken ""leapfrogs"" over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.
In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement. The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.
This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch
The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.

If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken ""leapfrogs"" over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.
In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement. The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.
This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch
The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.

Players represent aristocratic families at the Court of the Holy Roman Emperor. Players seek to get their family members into influential positions with the various electorships of the Empire. Once there they accumulate votes towards being elected to be Holy Roman Emperor. Players choose actions for their family members to take, which allow them to wrest control of the various Elector States (each of which has a special ability in addition to its voting power) whilst displacing their opponents. However, family members age and die and the number of action cards is limited, restricting the tactical options. As players build their influence they collect victory points and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 90 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Medieval, PoliticalMechanisme: Action Points, Area Majority / Influence, Take That, Voting, Worker PlacementMakersOntwerper: Ralf Burkert]]>","boardgames","14.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5649-kaiser-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26351-home_default/kaiser-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5649-kaiser-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","14.95","8717249191032","999-KAI01-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#810.000000}"

After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the Silk Road, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. Each action requires the use of one or more dice, and can be collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts or traveling on the board. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having trading posts in the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game.This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 40 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Dice, Economic, Medieval, TravelMechanisme: Contracts, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Resource to Move, Turn Order: Claim Action, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-up, Worker Placement with Dice WorkersMakersOntwerper: Simone Luciani, Daniele Tascini]]>","boardgames","41.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5689-marco-polo-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26334-home_default/marco-polo-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5689-marco-polo-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","41.95","8717249200413","999-MPO01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1760.000000}"

Some buildings provide income at the end of the round in the form of new cards, with certain buildings increasing the income provided by others; similarly, some buildings boost the VPs provided by others, with a University, for example, being worth one more VP for each School you have in play.Certain buildings have symbols on them  car, fountain, shopping cart - and the income and VPs provided by some buildings depends on how many symbols you have in play; the Autobahn, for example, is worth one dollar (i.e., card) and one VP for each car symbol you control.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, City BuildingMechanisme: Hand Management, Income, Multi-Use Cards, Race, Simultaneous Action Selection, TagsMakersOntwerper: Thomas Lehmann]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5695-metropolis-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26333-home_default/metropolis-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5695-metropolis-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8717249195818","999-MET01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#200.000000}"

In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons — the currency/points in the game — and someone is chosen as the start player.
On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.
In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn ""button income"": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.
What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.
Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)
When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.

On a turn, a player can first draw as many cards as he likes, one at a time from the deck, placing them in the harbor (an area near the deck). Each card shows one of the following:     Person, who stays in a face-up row next to deck.     Ship, which the player can attack immediately if he has enough swords on his people cards, after which the ship is discarded; otherwise, the ship stays in the harbor.     Expedition, which remains above the harbor until a player fulfills it by discarding people who have the items required for the expedition.     Tax Increase, which forces everyone with twelve or more coins to discard half their money, after which the card is discarded.If the player draws a ship with the same name as a ship already in the harbor, he's spent too much time dilly-dallying and his turn ends (after using the ship to attack, if possible), with all the cards in the harbor being discarded. Otherwise, the player can stop whenever he likes, then use/acquire one card if three or fewer ships are in the harbor, two cards if four ships are present, and three cards if five ships are present. Players rob ships, collecting the number of coins shown on them, then discarding the card, while they hire people, paying the number of coins depicted. After the active player takes his 1-3 cards, each other player may pay the active player one coin in order to take one card in the same way.When one player has at least twelve influence points — which are on both people and expedition cards — the game is played to the end of the round, giving everyone the same number of turns, then the player with the most influence points wins.• Port Royal differs from Händler der Karibik in that it includes ten more cards to allow for play with up to five players and players can win without fulfilling an expedition.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Economic, Nautical, PiratesMechanisme: Contracts, Events, Market, Move Through Deck, Open Drafting, Push Your Luck, Race, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alexander Pfister]]>","boardgames","14.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5724-port-royal-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26314-home_default/port-royal-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5724-port-royal-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","14.95","8717249199281","999-POR01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#320.000000}"

Whoever has the most cards in hand of one symbol or one color (but without duplicates) starts the game by laying these cards face up on the table as a set. Players then take turns in clockwise order.On a turn, a player must add at least one card to the table; if she can't, she draws nine new cards, shuffles her old hand into the deck, then plays. When she plays, she can play as many cards as she likes as long as they share a color or symbol. She can create a new set if she plays at least three cards or she can add her cards to existing sets (as long as she doesn't duplicate a color or symbol) or she can do both. On her turn, she can move cards from one set to another, possibly using these cards with cards that she plays in order to create a new set.The point of this gameplay is to create qwirkles, that is, a set of six cards that contains either each symbol in a single color or each color in a single symbol. When a player creates a qwirkle, she claims this set from the table. After a player's turn, she refills her hand to nine cards.The game continues until the deck runs out of cards.

Thereafter, a player adds blocks adjacent to at least one previously played block. The blocks must all be played in a line and match, without duplicates, either the color or shape of the previous block.

As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over.

In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards  one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc.  then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if the card turned up is a Jester, it is turned down and there is no trump for that round. If the card turned up is a Wizard, the dealer chooses one of the 4 suits as the trump suit. The dealer cannot choose no trump. On the last round of each game all cards are dealt out so there is no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, FantasyMechanisme: Betting and Bluffing, Hand Management, Predictive Bid, Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Ken Fisher]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5787-wizard-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26279-home_default/wizard-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5787-wizard-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8717249194088","999-WIZ01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#170.000000}"
"b029b421-8ab9-488c-8904-16082cef8940","<![CDATA[Thebes]]","<![CDATA[Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in time. So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the time to catch up.In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.This is the new entry for the Queen printing of Jenseits von Theben.  As the new game changes several mechanisms of the original, and is available in a much wider release, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.Re-implements:    Jenseits von ThebenAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Ancient, Exploration, TravelMechanisme: Point to Point Movement, Set Collection, Turn Order: Time TrackMakersOntwerper: Peter Prinz]]>","boardgames","42.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5822-thebes.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/20872-home_default/thebes.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5822-thebes.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","42.95","4010350604618","QNG60461","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1776.000000}"

The trick is, while each new Railcar must match the resource type or value of the one previously played, players always have the option to play any card face down as a Wild Railcar; the Wild Railcars don't have much value, but they can be used to save a player in a bind or to thwart your opponents by ""hiding"" a card they need.Yardmaster Express plays in ten minutes and consists of just 32 cards (no tokens, no cargo cards).AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 5 min.Leeftijd: 6+Soort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Print  Play, Trains, TransportationMechanisme: Open Drafting, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: David Short]]>","boardgames","11.55","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5827-way-up-high.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/20877-home_default/way-up-high.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5827-way-up-high.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","11.55","3760175512940","IEL51294","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#146.000000}"

The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes, the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower. Your job is to defeat them before they can reach you.At the beginning of each game round players draw a fate card, which will determine which category of creatures will advance one sector towards the tower and sometimes implement a nasty rule change for that particular game round. There are three categories of orcs which differ in strength and special abilities that are conveyed to a player once an orc is defeated.The game ends when you run out of orcs on one of the four lanes. During the final scoring, players count up their defeated orcs and multiply them by the number on the creature counter, get points for each support spell learned and subtract points for each poison card in their deck.

Featuring art by the French illustrator Marina Coudray, Dixit: Revelations looks utterly unlike any Dixit expansion that has preceded it. Coudray's mysterious and enchanting images are heavily influenced by early twentieth century design, from the Art Deco movement to Surrealism, even while they convey stories and ideas that may be millennia old. In her art you’ll find echoes of Picasso, Magritte, Matisse, Escher, Greek myth, Indian religion, pop music, internet memes, and much, much more... In these stylized pieces, reminiscent of New York City’s architecture and glass Tiffany lamps, you’ll find many allusions to ancient myths and folk tales.Dixit: Revelations is an expansion for Dixit that contains 84 new cards for use with that game. In Dixit, each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from his hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty, or otherwise doing something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If either no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all of the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on her card submission also scores.

The deck is shuffled, then set up with three or four Feeding time! cards shuffled into the deck at various points. On a turn, a player first turns up a card from the deck if the market is empty (as it is as the start of the game). Then the player looks at the fish and plant cards in the market and decides whether to pass or try to buy them. If he passes, he takes $2 from the bank and adds the top card to the market; if he wants to buy, all other players get to influence what's on the market and what the cards cost.First, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 1 of a buy. These cards force the active player to add, remove or swap a card from the market or simply allow the card player to make a fish swap of his own! (Players can also pass, with all action cards but the pass being set aside.) Second, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 2 of a buy. These cards add or subtract 1 from the cost of the market, or double or halve the cost of the market. In the latter case, the player of the card receives money from the active player instead of those coins going to the bank.Once the goods and the cost are set, the active player chooses to buy all the fish and plants on offer or none of them. The cost is equal to the sum of the card values, plus or minus any modifications, then doubled or halved as appropriate. All purchased cards go into a player's personal aquarium. If a player has two identical fish, he can move them to a separate breeding tank where they will earn him 1-3 coins each turn.Each time a Feeding time! card is revealed, players reveal one food cost card at random, then pay money equal to that cost times the number of stars on fish and plants in their aquariums. Any fish not fed starve and float away to the big toilet bowl in the sky. Each plant in an aquarium reduces the food cost by one.After the final Feeding time!, players count the stars on their non-breeding fish, then receive bonuses for collecting all colored fish of the same size, all three sizes of fish of the same color and different varieties of plants.

Both players have identical sets of ten fighters, with three fighters in each of three colors with values 1–3 along with a tri-colored boss valued at 4; these fighters are placed in small stacks of varying size onto a line that's eleven steps long. On a player's turn, he rolls the three colored dice and can make up to three moves accordingly, with the blue die moving a blue fighter, etc. Moving a fighter that has other fighters on top of him moves these other fighters as well.If, as a result of movement, his fighter (or stack of fighters) encounters an enemy, a fight between the two top cards in each stack occurs, the result of which is decided primarily by the color (via a rock-paper-scissors mechanism) and secondarily by the number (highest wins). If the boss wins a fight, its power is reduced by the enemy's power for the remainder of the current fight; if two fighters draw, they both retreat one step toward their own village, possibly precipitating other fights on the same turn. The fight continues until either pile is depleted.The first player to either defeat all of the opposing fighters or reach the end of the line (and clear out the opponent's fighters in his village) wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Soort spelType/Thema: Dice, FightingMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Rock-Paper-Scissors, Roll / Spin and MoveMakersOntwerper: Katsumasa Tomioka]]>","boardgames","13.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5975-ninja-taisen.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/21023-home_default/ninja-taisen.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/5975-ninja-taisen.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","13.95","3760175513657","IEL51365","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#226.000000}"

The Japanese Sixth Army was facing the Soviet 57th Special Corps, including Mongolian cavalry. At first, the battles were only short skirmishes, but it soon escalated into open war. The whole campaign lasted five months and ended with a Soviet victory. The six standard scenarios of this expansion can be played separately or as a campaign, with each scenario outcome impacting the following one. The pre-printed Breakthrough scenarios — Bain Tsagan Heights and Tightening the Noose — can be played in the campaign as well as one of the two Overlord scenarios, Encirclement at Khalkhin-Gol.The second Overlord scenario, Cape Torokina Landings, highlights the fierce battle for Cape Torokina between U.S. Marines and Japanese forces that took place years later; therefore, it is not part of the campaign.This expansion also includes six Soviet BA-10 Armored Cars and six Japanese Type 97 Te-Ke tankettes that players will find useful for many of the scenarios included.The Battles of Khalkhin-Gol is designed for 2 to 8 players. Each oversized map is ready-to-play with all terrain, obstacles, and unit positions pre-printed so players can simply add the figures and play. The various scenarios of the expansion require one copy of Memoir '44 (two for the Overlord scenarios), as well as the Terrain Pack, Eastern Front, and Pacific Theater expansions.

Each player starts with four colored train cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two cities, and you're trying to connect those two cities with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.On a turn, you either draw two train cards from the deck or discard train cards to claim a route between two cities; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two cities shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket. (If you can't connect cities on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)

Over the course of the game, players collect cards in order to then claim routes on the game board between two cities. Ideally the players create a network of routes that connect the cities showing on their secret ticket cards. Players score points both for claiming routes and for completing tickets, with incomplete tickets counting against a player's score.In addition to scoring points for tickets, whenever a player places a route on the board, they claim a passenger from the two cities that form the endpoints for that route (assuming that the passengers have not already been claimed). At the end of the game, whoever has the most passengers of each of the six colors scores 20 points for that color; whoever has the secondmost passengers in a color scores 10 points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.Ticket to Ride: Germany combines most of Zug um Zug: Deutschland and the Deutschland 1902 expansion in one box. Zug um Zug: Deutschland, published solely for the German and Austrian market, consisted of the same map as Ticket to Ride: Märklin, but ZuZ:D didn't include the passenger mechanism from Märklin in which players scored additional points by moving passengers from city to city. The Deutschland 1902 expansion introduced a different method of scoring passengers, and that method is now present in this collection.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Trains, TransportationMechanisme: Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alan R.

This narrative game for one to six players allows players to build their own unique hero and embark on six noble quests. Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!Prepare for AdventureLegacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books. Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story. Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale.Before you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become? Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk. Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history. Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party. For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here. Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any youve seen before.Explore The RealmOnce your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales. Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement. The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control. Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences. For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if youve already met their cousin, or if theyve heard of the great deeds youve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village. Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests. You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead. As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed.

During this time, you and your friends find yourselves amongst mysterious events. You are surrounded by strange figures, letters with unreadable texts, as well as sudden appearances of being unknown. By relying on your connections, you set out to investigate these incidents. Unknown to you are the frightful truths that lie in wait ahead of you...Lovecraft Letter is a card game that combines the Love Letter system with the world of H.P. Lovecraft. In addition to the standard sixteen cards in the Love Letter game are new versions of the cards that include special insanity powers. If you have one of these cards in your discard pile, then you are insane (at least for the current round) and on future turns can play insanity cards for their regular power or their special power, giving you more options during play. The risk, however, is that you must undergo a sanity check at the start of each of your turns, drawing as many cards from the deck as the number of insanity cards in front of you; draw one or more insanity cards, and you're out for the round.If you win the game, whether by being the last person standing or the player with the highest single card after the deck runs out, you win a token colored to reflect whether you were sane or insane. Win enough tokens of the right type, and you win the game. Cthluhu can also help you win the game if you release it at the right time...Will you put an end to the evil schemes as an investigator, or will you help guide the world to destruction as one of insanity's disciples? It all depends on you.1920AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 5 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Deduction, Fantasy, HorrorMechanisme: Hand Management, Player Elimination, Score-and-Reset GameMakersOntwerper: Seiji Kanai]]>","boardgames","40","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6381-lovecraft-letter.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26863-home_default/lovecraft-letter.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6381-lovecraft-letter.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","40","","zman-5123","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#632.000000}"

"9df32b76-9225-46cb-a27f-64e2db45a7c7","<![CDATA[Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition)]]","<![CDATA[Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex as the new masters of the galaxy.No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board. An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system, claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in unpredictable ways.After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game, providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.—description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 240 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Civilization, Economic, Exploration, Negotiation, Political, Science Fiction, Space Exploration, WargameMechanisme: Action Drafting, Area Majority / Influence, Area-Impulse, Dice Rolling, Follow, Grid Movement, Hexagon Grid, Increase Value of Unchosen Resources, King of the Hill, Modular Board, Race, Tech Trees / Tech Tracks, Trading, Variable Phase Order, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-up, VotingMakersOntwerper: Dane Beltrami, Corey Konieczka, Christian T.

For centuries, the country has relied upon a series of dikes and wind-powered pumps to keep it safe from the constant threat of flooding from the North Sea, but this system is no longer enough.In Pandemic: Rising Tide, it is your goal to avert tragedy by constructing four modern hydraulic structures in strategic locations that will help you defend the country from being reclaimed by the ocean. Storms are brewing and the seas are restless. It will take all your guile to control the flow of water long enough to usher in the future of the Netherlands. It's time to get to work.Containing the water that threatens to consume the countryside is your greatest challenge. Water levels in a region are represented by cubes, and as the water containment systems currently in place begin to fail, more water cubes are added to the board. With water levels constantly on the rise, failure to maintain the containment system could quickly lead to water spilling across the board.To successfully build the four hydraulic structures needed to win a game of Pandemic: Rising Tide, you must first learn to predict and manipulate the flow of water. Failing to maintain safe water levels throughout the country can bring you perilously close to failing your mission. Fortunately, water can be corralled by a strategically placed dike or slowed by pumping water out of a region. Correctly identifying and intervening in at-risk areas can get you one step closer to victory.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: EnvironmentalMechanisme: Action Points, Area Movement, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire Game, Trading, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Jeroen Doumen, Matt Leacock]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6623-pandemic-rising-tide-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/21680-home_default/pandemic-rising-tide-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6623-pandemic-rising-tide-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","49.95","8717371241469","ZMG7122NL","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1136.000000}"

Who wants a blind chicken, after all? They just peck at things randomly, making a mess of the house.The game consists of fifty number cards (0-49), seven penalty cards, and three reward cards. Adjust the number deck based on the player count, then deal cards evenly to all players. After receiving their cards, players order the cards in their hand however they wish, but then cannot change the order during play. Each round starts with the active player playing the leftmost or rightmost card in their hand, then everyone else does the same in clockwise order, again playing only their  leftmost or rightmost card. Whoever plays the highest valued card takes the trick, then leads to the next trick. If you take a trick with more than one chicken in it, you take a penalty card equal to the number of chickens you took; if you take a trick with exactly one pig in it, then you receive a reward card that gives you a bonus in the next round, such as playing your card face down or playing from any spot in your hand.Once all the cards have been played, players tally their scores: each chicken claimed in -1 point, penalty cards are -3 to -15 points, and reward cards are +3 points. Whoever took the last trick can choose to ignore all chickens they took or all penalty cards they took other than those taken on the last trick. If someone uses the 0 to beat the 49 in the last trick, then they can alternatively erase the entire score from a previous game.Play as many games as the number of players, then whoever has the highest score wins!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-5Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Michael Schacht]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6710-kippig.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/21765-home_default/kippig.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6710-kippig.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026302429","WGG1727","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#130.000000}"

Each time that you draw cards, you must take a colored tile that's 2-5 train cars long and place that tile on an empty track bed. Once you've done this, any player can claim that route by discarding the appropriately colored cards from hand, as in any other Ticket to Ride game. (Single-length routes are already colored, and the map contains a number of gray-colored ferry routes.)Multiple track beds on the game board overlap, and once a tile has placed on the board, any track beds crossed by this tile are off-limits and nothing can be built on them. At the end of the game, players score their tickets, with bonuses being awarded for longest continuous route and most tickets completed.In the Old West half of the expansion, 2-6 players start the game by choosing (in reverse player order) a starting location for one of their three city pieces. The first route that a player claims must have this city as one of the route's two endpoints, and each subsequent route claimed must connect to that player's existing network.After claiming a route, a player can place one of their remaining cities on either end of that route by discarding a matching pair of train cards. Only one city marker can be in each city. Whenever a player builds a route that connects to a city owned by another player, the owner of the city claims the points for the route, not the player placing the trains. If both endpoints of the route have cities, then the owner of each city scores these points. Whoever completes the most tickets in this expansion scores 15 bonus points.As a variant, you can play Old West with Alvin the Alien. No player can start the game in Roswell, and the first player who builds a route into Roswell scores 10 points, then places the Alvin marker in any city that they control. The next player to connect to this city scores 10 points, then moves Alvin as before. Whoever controls Alvin at the end of the game scores 10 bonus points.]]>","boardgames","44.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6889-ticket-to-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-west.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/21953-home_default/ticket-to-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-west.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6889-ticket-to-ride-map-collection-volume-6-france-old-west.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","44.95","824968721285","DOW720128","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1660.000000}"

De kaarten in je deck rouleren steeds van je trekstapel naar je hand, waarna ze naar je aflegstapel gaan. Als je trekstapel leeg is, schud je je aflegstapel, zodat je weer een nieuwe trekstapel hebt. Elke beurt mag je 1 actie uitvoeren en 1 aankoop doen. De verschillende kaarten in je hand helpen je daarbij of kunnen dit aantal vermeerderen. Geldkaarten vormen je kapitaal voor die beurt. Met puntenkaarten kun je niets in je beurt, maar je hebt ze uiteindelijk wel nodig om het spel te winnen. Elke beurt koop je er kaarten bij, waardoor je op jouw manier je doel kunt bereiken. Ga je voor een constructieve methode met de Smidse, het Dorp en de Markt, of probeer je het op een agressievere manier met de Heks of de Militie? Omdat in elk spel maar 10 van de 26 koninkrijkkaarten worden gebruikt, is Dominion iedere keer weer anders.Deze tweede editie van Dominion bevat puntenkaarten, geldkaarten en 26 verschillende koninkrijkkaarten. In vergelijking met de eerste editie zijn er 6 koninkrijkkaarten vervangen en is er 1 toegevoegd.Dominion is één van de weinige expertspellen die je binnen een half uur kunt spelen.

(Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)To set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5×5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5×5 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.Collectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents — without revealing an assassin — before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier. After the first clue is given, players alternate giving clues.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 11+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Deduction, Spies/Secret Agents, Word GameMechanisme: Communication Limits, Cooperative Game, Push Your LuckMakersOntwerper: Vlaada Chvátil, Scot Eaton]]>","boardgames","21.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6943-codenames-duet-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/23462-home_default/codenames-duet-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6943-codenames-duet-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","21.95","8718026302580","WGG1743","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#640.000000}"

For centuries, the country has relied upon a series of dikes and wind-powered pumps to keep it safe from the constant threat of flooding from the North Sea, but this system is no longer enough.In Pandemic: Rising Tide, it is your goal to avert tragedy by constructing four modern hydraulic structures in strategic locations that will help you defend the country from being reclaimed by the ocean. Storms are brewing and the seas are restless. It will take all your guile to control the flow of water long enough to usher in the future of the Netherlands. It's time to get to work.Containing the water that threatens to consume the countryside is your greatest challenge. Water levels in a region are represented by cubes, and as the water containment systems currently in place begin to fail, more water cubes are added to the board. With water levels constantly on the rise, failure to maintain the containment system could quickly lead to water spilling across the board.To successfully build the four hydraulic structures needed to win a game of Pandemic: Rising Tide, you must first learn to predict and manipulate the flow of water. Failing to maintain safe water levels throughout the country can bring you perilously close to failing your mission. Fortunately, water can be corralled by a strategically placed dike or slowed by pumping water out of a region. Correctly identifying and intervening in at-risk areas can get you one step closer to victory.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: EnvironmentalMechanisme: Action Points, Area Movement, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire Game, Trading, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Jeroen Doumen, Matt Leacock]]>","boardgames","54.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6978-pandemic-rising-tide-en.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/22061-home_default/pandemic-rising-tide-en.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/6978-pandemic-rising-tide-en.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","54.95","841333104320","[ib]ZMG7122","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1118.000000}"

You want to win on your own, but to advance, you must inevitably help your opponent...On your turn, you’ll play at least 2 cards from your hand of 6. The twist comes from where you can play them. Of course, your own ascending and descending piles are fair game and follow the normal rules of The Game. But exactly once per turn, you can play a card on one of your opponent’s piles, breaking all rules.

Though they seem to worship different gods, the investigators have found a thread that runs throughout all of the cultists’ horrific rites.In Masks of Nyarlathotep, each of these sects pursues the awakening of an aspect of the same horrific creature: Nyarlathotep. This being is known as the Messenger of the Outer Gods, and he is the only Ancient One that still actively walks among humanity. The investigators must work to stop the cults springing up to serve his many guises, or Nyarlathotep will gain enough strength to open the Ultimate Gate, ushering in an unthinkable doom. Strike down these cults in new Adventures, explore ancient mysteries among new Mystic Ruins, and destroy the monstrous followers of Nyarlathotep. New to this expansion, Personal Stories unique to each character add stakes to the actions undertaken by each investigator, and a Campaign mode adds a fresh challenge and enriches the narrative of the investigators’ struggles to stop the many cults worshipping the multitude of faces worn by one dread being in Eldritch Horror: Masks of Nyarlathotep!—description from the publisher]]>","boardgames","55","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7191-eldritch-horror-masks-of-nyarlathotep.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/22444-home_default/eldritch-horror-masks-of-nyarlathotep.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7191-eldritch-horror-masks-of-nyarlathotep.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","55","841333105136","[ib]FFEH09","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1108.000000}"

Players take turns laying a domino on the table, with each placed domino after the first lying adjacent to at least one side of a tile or on top of two tiles.Once everyone has only one domino in hand, players reveal that tile and score points for the round. For each type of animal on your tile, you find the largest orthogonally-connected group of that animal, then score 1 point for each animal in the group. If you have the same animal on both halves of your last tile, you score that animal twice. If you have a type of animal on your tile that no one else has, double the score for that animal.After scoring, return the revealed tile to hand, then draw more tiles to fill your hand once again.

King of the Dice
You're finally a king! All your dreams have been fulfilled. You sit content in your castle and look out over your wonderful kingdom. Green meadows, rolling fields, high mountains and clear rivers stretch as far as your eyes can see... but one thing is missing from your kingdom: citizens! So you announce the merits of the kingdom all over the country – in the rich cities, to the crazy gnomes in their workshops, to the dwarves in their deep mines, and also to the orcs, fairies and the sorcerer's apprentices. But they aren't easily convinced; after all there are also other kings trying to win them over. That's why you need skill and luck with the dice to entice the best citizens to your kingdom. But watch out for scoundrels and dragons. Otherwise your thriving kingdom will soon be a wretched wasteland, and you'll have to watch as someone else is crowned King of the Dice.
Make your kingdom thrive!
Step 1: Gain new citizens for your kingdom by fulfilling the various requirements on the cards with three rolls of the dice.Step 2: Special cards provide you with benefits. But watch out for scoundrels and dragons.Step 3: The player with the best citizens at the end wins the game!

But what's hiding underneath? Suddenly there's a pair of curious eyes looking up at you. Crazy monsters have hidden themselves away under all the junk. And wow, do they look hungry! Will you be brave enough to feed them? It's best to feed only the hungriest of the monsters because after they've had something to eat, they burp so loudly that you get scared and run toward the exit. And grandma's guard dog, Pit, is sitting there...In Bitte nicht füttern!, only players who keep track of where the hungriest monsters are hidden and can distract the guard dog with a bone can continue to feed the monsters undisturbed!

On one of their expeditions the dragon children Mira, Feo, Luna and Diego discover an unusual sparkling treasure: a column of ice with sparkling stones frozen inside it.They want to take the treasure back to their cave. But unfortunately the column of ice is too heavy. The only thing they can do is to melt it. But breathing fire isn't as easy as it sounds. Instead of fire they only manage hot air. Then the four of them have an idea: they'll get their dad to help.And it works! Dad's fire breathing starts melting the column, and little by little the sparkling stones start falling out. The dragon children quickly collect the valuable treasures, and take them back to their cave.With a little luck even dad will get a few sparkling stones!

Things have been a little crazy since gold was found in the once sleepy village of Old Town! Once infected by the gold rush fever, everyone from experienced gold miners to hotel owners are grabbing a few sticks of dynamite and running to the ghost mine. They throw their dynamite sticks — BOOM, BANG!!! — into the mine every hour to blow the gold out of the mountain at any cost!Don't wait, start collecting! But be careful! Anyone who comes across a bat, snake, rat or ghost amongst the gold nuggets needs to get to safety quickly. And there are all sorts of other dangers lurking in the Wild West: the tense atmosphere means you might be challenged to a duel. And if the sheriff has you in his sights there's no escaping...Boom, Bang, Gold is an exciting game with plenty of action in which speed and a good eye are important. The person who manages to collect the most nuggets in their gold chest at the end of the day wins the fast-paced hunt for gold.In more detail, to set up, place the gold mine, filled with face-down shuffled tiles, in the center of the table. Set the pocket watch to 1:00, then give each player one stick of dynamite, one shelf, and one character with a gold chest.On a turn, everyone throws their dynamite sticks into the gold mine at the same time, then they all search (using only one hand) to remove face-up tiles from the mine and place the tiles on their personal shelf. If you spot a special tile with bat, rat, snake, or ghost, call ""Watch out!"" so that everyone else must place their hands on their head and call out ""Help!"" before continuing to play. When no more face-up tiles remain, the round ends.Players can play action tiles to flip over extra tiles, throw an extra piece of dynamite, duel with another player, and more. After twelve rounds, whoever has the most gold wins!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: Action / Dexterity, Party Game, Real-timeMechanisme: Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Alexandre Emerit]]>","boardgames","24.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7282-boom-bang-gold.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/22271-home_default/boom-bang-gold.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7282-boom-bang-gold.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Haba]]","24.95","4010168231266","HAB303337-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#875.000000}"

It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.In more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level.

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go ""into decline"". A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 40 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Fantasy, Fighting, Territory BuildingMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Area Movement, Dice Rolling, Hidden Victory Points, Increase Value of Unchosen Resources, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-up, Victory Points as a ResourceMakersOntwerper: Philippe Keyaerts]]>","boardgames","58.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7385-small-world-en.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/22637-home_default/small-world-en.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7385-small-world-en.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","58.95","824968726914","DOW7901","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1962.000000}"

At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their native currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external wall section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.Integrates with:    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: City Building, MedievalMechanisme: Hand Management, Memory, Open Drafting, Set Collection, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Dirk Henn]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7398-alhambra.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31647-home_default/alhambra.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7398-alhambra.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","49.95","4010350104323","QUE10432","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1188.000000}"

During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that players existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards, special actions, and terrain sectors to build the map!  Kingdom Builder: Big Box ramps up this variability by including all expansions to date, ensuring you'll never play the same game twice!Kingdom Builder: Big Box includes the four expansions Nomads, Crossroads, Marshlands and Harvest as well as three Queenies (Capitol, Caves and Island).(The first edition Big Box has only the first 2 expansions and queenies.)Note: At least the first printing of Kingdom Builder: Big Box (Second Edition) had misprinted Task cards for the Crossroads Expansion.

Tip Tap, players must race to finger the right items on the table  but winning an item isn't good enough as you need to protect it from being stolen while still hunting for more.In more detail, you set up the game by placing all of the multi-colored and strangely shaped cardboard bits on the table. Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.If a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected.

By placing the tiles in this expansion, players build hills and vineyards, trying to plan ahead to claim the sweetest meadows for points  bringing sheep and shepherds while keeping watch for the wolf that waits to be drawn among the tiles...Whenever a tile featuring a hill icon is added to the playing area, it is placed on top of another randomly drawn tile, elevating it above the playing surface and creating a hill. Hill tiles act as tie-breakers: if two or more players occupy the same feature equally (a shared majority), but one of the tied players has a follower standing on a hill tile, that player will have an advantage over the others, and will score all the points for that feature.Vineyards are designed to increase the importance of monasteries. Each vineyard tile placed around a monastery adds three points to that monastery's score. However, these bonus points only count if the monastery is completed, so players are more likely to sabotage their opponents' monasteries in order to prevent them from being finished.Shepherds are new pieces that can only be placed in fields. Each time a player expands the field occupied by his or her shepherd, that player has two options: 1. Draw a sheep token out of a bag, placing it near their shepherd; or 2. Trade in all their accumulated sheep for points. Each sheep token is worth 1-4 points, depending on the number of sheep depicted. However, hidden among the sheep tokens are two wolf tokens, and if a player draws one of these, all of their sheep are lost and placed back into the bag. This introduces a push-your-luck aspect to Carcassonne, as players can choose to either cash-in the sheep they have, or try to add more sheep and risk losing them all.The goal of Hills  Sheep remains the same as in basic Carcassonne: claim the most points to win the game.

It's part of a line of combined dice-and-card games that publisher AMIGO Spiel introduced in 2012.As you might expect with a game titled Piraten Kapern, players must set off in search of treasure, pushing themselves to find as much as possible without losing their heads.At the start of a turn, the active player rolls the eight special dice. He must set aside any skulls rolled, and his turn ends immediately with no score if he rolls a third skull. The player is free to set aside any number of other dice, rerolling the rest. He may continue to do this until the skulls get him or he stops. He then scores for dice combinations, with a three-of-a-kind earning 100 points, a four-of-a-kind 200 points, and so on all the way up to an eight-of-a-kind earning 4,000 points. Each gold or diamond showing is worth 100 points on its own. A player earns a 500 point bonus if all eight dice score.If a player is not able to set aside any valid dice, all points are lost.If a player rolls four or more skulls on his first roll, he heads to Skull Island for the turn, setting aside those skulls and continuing to roll as long as he sets aside at least one skull each time. Once he stops, all other players lose 100 points for each skull showing.Before a player starts to roll for his turn, however, he draws a card from the pirate deck, which affects what's possible on that turn: He might score double for the treasure he collects, or need to roll sabers to fight off other pirates, or receive a free diamond or gold coin, or be able to score treasure even if he collect three skulls.Once a player reaches 6,000 points, all other players take one final turn, then the player with the most points wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Dice, PiratesMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Push Your Luck, Re-rolling and Locking, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Haim Shafir]]>","boardgames","15.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7475-1000-bommen-granaten.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/26502-home_default/1000-bommen-granaten.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/7475-1000-bommen-granaten.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","15.95","8719214424725","999-DUI01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#200.000000}"

In Merlin, players move their knights or Merlin with the help of dice around the action ring to get the most desired actions. While the knights are only moved by the corresponding player, Merlin can be moved by all players, which makes integrating Merlin in one's plan a tricky endeavor.
There are multiple ways to score victory points such as defeating barbarians, building manors in the surrounding area and increasing one's influence in the six counties. Additionally, players can fulfill task cards during their turn to get more victory points. The player who plans his actions most efficiently will ultimately have the most points and thus will be the royal successor of King Arthur.

A large pillar of smoke showed that a bomb had exploded in the Houses of Parliament. Security forces were activated immediately and they arrested a suspicious young laborer near the area.Mycroft Holmes, at the service of the crown, was commissioned to investigate the relationship of the young laborer with anarchist groups. He thinks it will be an easy task that he can do from the comfort of his armchair in the Diogenes Club — until he is informed of disturbing news; his younger brother Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, has been hired by the boy's parents to prove the innocence of his son, who believes to be a scapegoat of a dark conspiracy.For the first time, the brightest minds in London face each other. Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?A game of Holmes: Sherlock  Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways. The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7.

Each X-Wing ship flies differently, with its own set of maneuvers ranging from gentle banks to aggressive Koiogran turns. As in the game’s first edition, you’ll need to use every ship’s maneuvering capabilities to the fullest in order to strategically position your ships. A round begins with players secretly selecting a maneuver on each of their ships’ unique maneuver dials. Once you’ve decided how each of your ships is going to fly, you’ll begin revealing the dials and moving your ships, starting with the lowest skilled pilots.As you move, you’ll enter a tense duel with your opponent as you both try to line up the perfect shot. Before you can open fire on an opponent’s ship, however, they must be in your firing arc and within range. By carefully selecting your maneuvers, you can get enemy ships in your sights, and once you’ve locked onto your target, you’re free to choose your plan of attack. You might pepper the enemy with blaster fire to whittle away their shields. Or, you could go for massive damage and launch a devastating volley of proton torpedoes. No matter how you approach the battle, you have complete control of your squadron. One player wins when all of their opponent’s ships are destroyed!Slick flying is certainly important, but it isn’t the only consideration you’ll have to make in the midst of a dogfight. As in the first edition of X-Wing, once your ships have completed a maneuver, you can also perform an action to gain the upper hand. Whether you choose to acquire a target lock on a rival ship or barrel roll out of an enemy’s firing arc, the actions you take affect the course of the battle and determine the fate of your squadron.Now, in the second edition of the game, your actions offer greater strategic depth than ever before. Some actions are red and induce stress when they are used. Other actions may be linked, allowing you to chain two actions together and push the limits of how your ship can handle in a dogfight!—description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Aviation / Flight, Bluffing, Collectible Components, Miniatures, Movies / TV / Radio theme, Science Fiction, WargameMechanisme: Action Queue, Critical Hits and Failures, Dice Rolling, Line of Sight, Movement Template, Player Elimination, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Jay Little, Max Brooke, Frank Brooks]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/8621-star-wars-x-wing-second-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/23954-home_default/star-wars-x-wing-second-edition.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/8621-star-wars-x-wing-second-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","49.95","841333105587","FFSWZ01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#718.000000}"

When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.Part of Ticket to Ride series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: TrainsMechanisme: Connections, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alan R.

Each player chooses an employee to help them look after the park. Employees have various skills, which allow them to place buildings and create dinosaurs for example. You spread word about the park by entertaining your visitors. However, be careful! The more dinosaurs the park contains, the greater the chance of break outs with gruesome consequences.Jurassic World is a cooperative board game from 2 to 6 players. It's a combination of making the right choices with your teammates and some luck with rolling the dice. Players start their turn together by placing their banners strategically in the preparation phase. In the action phase players take actions based on where they placed their banner in the previous phase. In the action phase players take actions, for example: Digging up dinosaurs, researching dinosaurs, placing dinosaurs in their paddock, building entertainment buildings or buying upgrades. They succeed in these actions by rolling the right numbers with the dice. If all that is going according to plans, players will be able to fulfill all the requirements of a mission and win the game.

As in the original game, players each have an individual score sheet, and they're trying to use numbers (1-18) to fill in the empty spaces in three rows, which are colored orange, yellow and purple. Within a row, lower numbers must be placed to the left of higher numbers, and no number can be repeated. In the two- and three-space columns formed by the rows, no number can be repeated, but numbers can be in any order.Aside from the score sheet, the game includes 32 cards, with the cards numbered 0-6 and -2 in four colors (yellow, orange, purple, gray). Each player starts with a random hand of three cards, then four cards are laid in a 2x2 square. On a turn, a player lays a card from their and onto one of the cards in the square, then sums that card and the two adjacent cards, stating this number and the color of all non-grey cards out loud, e.g., ""13 in purple and yellow"". Each player can then write a 13 in either the purple or yellow row on their score sheet. If the number is less than 1 or all the cards are grey, then no one can write anything; if the active player can't write anything on their score sheet, then they must mark a penalty box instead.If a player has two cards with the same number, they can lay down one of them, then the matching number in an adjacent space, thus possibly changing the sum drastically. A player refills their hand to three cards to end their turn.When a player has completely filled two rows with numbers or all four penalty spaces on their score sheet, the game ends. Each player tallies the points for each of their rows: 1 point per number if spaces are empty, or as many points as the rightmost number if the row is full. For each three-space column, if all spaces are filled, then the player scores points equal to the number in the pentagon. For each penalty point, the player loses 5 points.

To set up, give everyone a ship that has room for twelve items (four under the deck out of view of others), then dump all of the equipment tiles in the center of the table. Take thirteen adventure cards in the appropriate number of the appropriate types (discovery, trade, pirates, contract), then lay them out in a circle around the equipment.When everyone is ready, reveal the adventure cards, then race to fill your ship with equipment tiles using only one hand, adding two colored goods in the special slots for those. Whoever finishes first scoops the cards up so that everyone else has to finish equipping their ship without seeing what's coming. You then shuffle the cards, then reveal them one by one:    Discovery: When this type of card is revealed, you can discard the 1 or 2 equipment tiles shown to receive the goods or money instead. Whenever you receive goods, they must be placed in an empty space on your ship; you can discard equipment to make room for them, if you wish.    Trade: You can trade the one good on the left of the card for the 2-3 goods on the right, if you wish.    Pirates: Before revealing this card, every player must say either fight or flee. If you flee, nothing happens to you. If you fight, you must be able to discard the equipment shown on the card or else you're penalized and must ditch some money and aa good; if you do have the equipment to drive the pirates away, you receive the reward shown on the card.    Contract: Place this on the bottom of the deck until only contract cards remain, then reveal them one by one. If you have the 1-4 goods showing on the card, you can discard them to get the monetary reward.At the end of the round, convert every remaining good into 1 coin, then for each ten coins, convert them into a treasure chest and place it on an empty space in your boat.

Play continues, with each set-aside tile determining where the next player can go until:    A player forms a line with four of her tokens in any direction,    A player forms a 2x2 square with four of her tokens, or    A player chooses a tile which doesn't allow her opponent to place a token.In any of these cases, the player has won the game. A match can be a single game, a best of three series, or a point-based match, with the winner of a game earning as many points as the number of tiles remaining in the grid when she wins; in this case, the player who first collects ten points wins the match.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 10 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: Abstract StrategyMechanisme: Pattern BuildingMakersOntwerper: Bruno Cathala]]>","boardgames","17.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9235-okiya.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25213-home_default/okiya.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9235-okiya.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Blue Orange]]","17.95","3770000904772","BLU-00497","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#486.000000}"

The totems they create represent the values of their family, village, courage and culture. The tribe that makes the most prestigious totem poles wins the contest...In Wakanda, players compete to create valuable totem poles, but the value of the poles is determined as much by where they stand as by what's in them. Each player starts the game with three headdresses. Six of eight village tiles are placed in a row, with three of the tiles tilted 90 to show that they're out of play; each tile has a unique scoring rule on it, and that rule will apply for all of a player's totem poles if he acquires that tile.On a turn, a player first draws one totem pole from the bag; the game includes 21 totem pole pieces: one eagle, two chiefs, three tomahawks, four animal skins, five teepees and six suns. The player then either places one of his totem pole pieces on an available village tile OR places one of his headdresses on an existing totem pole to claim it; in the latter case, he places this tile in front of himself and tilts the next village tile in line (if any) to make it available for play.Once all six poles have been claimed, the players tally their score based on the rules on their tiles, e.g. score 3 points per animal skin on all of your poles or score 2 points per piece for your tallest pole.

"0d1d05f6-289f-479b-b838-253e96d68e6c","<![CDATA[Metro (2de Editie)]]","<![CDATA[Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.For those interested in graph theory, a key part of the Metro game design is that the routes will always connect a starting subway train station with an empty destination station, rather than routing to another starting subway train station. The tiles implement a design principle which allows any tile to be placed on any open grid space, subject to rules for alignment with existing tile edges. If correctly placed per the rules, the routing will allow for all trains to score, albeit not necessarily for the high run value the owner would like to attain.The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).Re-implemented by:     Cable CarAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: TrainsMechanisme: Network and Route Building, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Dirk Henn]]>","boardgames","42.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9553-metro-2de-editie.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25526-home_default/metro-2de-editie.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9553-metro-2de-editie.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","42.95","4010350102411","QUE795241","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1440.000000}"

The grandiose cities on these islands are powered by magical energy from a rare crystal.In the tile-laying game Skylands, you are tasked with building part of the Skylands kingdom. Go exploring for new areas of wood, stone, and most importantly, crystalline, as you seek to build the grandest part of the Kingdom.On their turn, a player selects one of four actions: Explore, Harvest, Build, or Collect Energy. All players get to take the action, but the player who selected it gets an extra bonus. A player cannot select the same action two turns in a row. The actions allow players to select tiles and place them in their tableau, building out their landscape of Skylands, forest, and quarries. Completing these geographic features allows them to harvest resources, collect crystals, and build special buildings. The game continues until one player fills their tableau or all the tiles have been placed. Players receive points for their special buildings, materials, and points earned during the game, and the player with the most points wins.Skylands includes special buildings for beginner, intermediate, and advanced play, as well as a campaign mode, and five small expansions (Queenies) for more complexity.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: Exploration, FantasyMechanisme: Enclosure, Follow, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Shun Taguchi, Aya Taguchi]]>","boardgames","37.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9564-skylands.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25537-home_default/skylands.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9564-skylands.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","37.95","4010350202425","QUE795242","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1758.000000}"

They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the ‘Imascheren’ (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round their new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Arabian, Card GameMechanisme: End Game Bonuses, Modular Board, Open Drafting, Set Collection, Square Grid, Turn Order: Progressive, Worker PlacementMakersOntwerper: Andreas Steiger]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9576-targi.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25549-home_default/targi.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9576-targi.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","19.95","8718026302962","WGG1839","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#434.000000}"

Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Bluffing, Card Game, Fantasy, FightingMechanisme: Betting and Bluffing, Memory, Player Elimination, Push Your LuckMakersOntwerper: Hisanori Hiraoka, Masato Uesugi]]>","boardgames","14.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9586-welcome-to-the-dungeon-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25559-home_default/welcome-to-the-dungeon-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9586-welcome-to-the-dungeon-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","14.95","8717371241209","IEL51234NL","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#238.000000}"

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the ""normal"" spread of the infections.Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.Pandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: MedicalMechanisme: Action Points, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Set Collection, Tags, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Matt Leacock]]>","boardgames","46.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9658-pandemic-2nd-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25624-home_default/pandemic-2nd-edition.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9658-pandemic-2nd-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","46.95","681706711003","ZMG71100","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1054.000000}"

"899a1fc6-4f18-46a1-862e-39834a86a47a","<![CDATA[Lost Cities - Het Kaartspel (NL)]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.
Lost Cities is a card game in the Kosmos two-player series. The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2–10 in five different colors with three special ""handshakes"" (""HS"" in scoring examples below) in each suit.
The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the color-appropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.
The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of -20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together.
Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial -20.
Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial -20, ×3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.
Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 plus the initial -20, ×2 for the multiplier.

While the color and number arrangement is the same on all player boards, the starting point differs on each board. (The second edition of Träxx includes a pad of individual score sheets instead of erasable boards.)To play, shuffle the deck of fifteen cards, then reveal the top card, which will show four or five colored hexagons. Playing at the same time, each player takes an erasable pen and draws a path on their game board — with this path starting at or at least passing through the starting point on their board — that covers up to as many hexagons as were revealed, with the colors of the hexagons in your path matching those shown on the card. Thus, if the card shows two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow, then your path can cover at most two gray hexagons and one each of blue, red and yellow.Once all players have drawn their path, reveal the next card, continuing the path in either direction and covering only as many hexagons of the proper colors as is shown on that card. A path cannot cross itself.When your path crosses a number, call out that number. If you're the first one to reach it, you'll score that many points at game end; if others have reached it first, you score half this many points, rounded up.

Each round, a set of dice are rolled in the middle of the table, determining which kind of road and railway routes are available to all players. You have to draw these routes on your erasable boards to create transport lines and connect your exits, trying to optimize the available symbols better than your opponents.
The more exits you connect, the more points you score at the end of the game, but you lose points for each incomplete route, so plan carefully! Will you press your luck and try to stretch your transportation network to the next exit, or will you play it safe and start a new, simpler to manage route?
Railroad Ink comes in two versions, each one including two expansions with additional dice sets that add special rules to your games. The Blazing Red Edition includes the Lava and Meteor expansions. Try to confine the lava coming from the erupting volcano before it destroys your routes, or deal with the havoc brought by the meteor strikes and mine the craters for precious ore. These special rules can spice up things and make each game play and feel different.
Each box allows you to play from 1 to 6 players, and if you combine more boxes, you can play with up to 12 players (or more). The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!

Each card is sleeved, and within the sleeve on its back is a rule explaining how this card can be swapped with another card: swap it with a red card, a card with an even number, a card with a higher number, and so on. You can look at all the rules on cards in front of you, but you cannot communicate to others what those rules are. You cannot change the order of cards in front of you.On a turn, a player must swap one of their cards (following that card's rule) with another player's card, then someone records that move on a chart. Blanks are considered to be 0 and an even number for the purpose of swaps. When one of your cards is swapped, you can look at the rule on the card you receive. You can suggest moves to others or ask questions of them, and they can respond with ""yes"" or ""no"" answers as long as they don't identify the rule on any of their cards.If you place all the numbers in numerical order (disregarding blanks) in either clockwise or counterclockwise order before you would need to make a 25th move, you all win the game. Your team's score is ""Great"", ""Good"", ""Horrible"", etc. based on how many moves it took you to win. If you don't win, then you must all be worse than horrible, which is very bad indeed.In the game's expert mode, you cannot speak at all and you cannot undo a player's swap on your next turn.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-5Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, DeductionMechanisme: Communication Limits, Cooperative Game, Pattern BuildingMakersOntwerper: Daniel Fehr]]>","boardgames","17","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9885-narabi.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/25888-home_default/narabi.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/9885-narabi.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","17","841333107963","ZMGZM017","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#116.000000}"

The goal is to force another player to collect 4 of any one type of critter.The deck includes 64 cards, with eight copies of eight types of critters. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players.On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., Stink bug. The player receiving the card either     Accepts the card, says either true or false, then reveals the card. If this player is wrong in her claim, she keeps the card on the table in front of her face up; if she is right, the player who gave her the card places it face up before him.     Peeks at the card, then passes it face down to another player, either saying the original type of critter or saying a new type. This new player again has the choice of accepting the card or passing it, unless the card has already been seen by all other players in which case the player must take the first option.Whoever lost a challenge and had to place the card before him on the table begins the next round.The game ends when a player has no cards to pass on his turn or when a player has four cards of the same critter on the table in front of him.

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!  Many questions are asked over and over in the forums...

Such knowledge is difficult to come by, even in a place like Arkham, but you do know of one witch whose story has been passed down for nearly two hundred years: Keziah, who escaped from the Salem Gaol back in the late 1600s and whose ghost still supposedly haunts the condemned Witch House in French Hill. With many questions and few leads, you have no choice but to chase the ghosts of Arkham’s past.As a new cycle begins, you will need new tools to help you battle these unholy forces. To help you with this task, some of the new player cards in The Secret Name belong to more than one class. These cards, which can be identified by their golden hue and dual class icons in the upper right corner of the card, can be added to your investigator’s deck if you have access to either of the classes detailed on the card. If, however, an investigator has limited access to one of the classes on a multiclass card, that card will occupy one of the investigator’s limited slots, even if they have unlimited access to the other class detailed on the card. But with diverse uses and powerful effects, they make a worthy addition to any investigator’s arsenal.]]>","boardgames","17.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10129-arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-secret-name-mythos-pack.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27589-home_default/arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-secret-name-mythos-pack.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10129-arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-secret-name-mythos-pack.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","17.95","841333107826","FFAHC30","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#130.000000}"

As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. To do so, players need to assemble a crew, collect provisions, and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. Glory can be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie, so gather your warriors because it's raiding season!To impress the Chieftain, you need victory points (VPs), with those being acquired primarily by raiding settlements, taking plunder, and making offerings to the Chieftain. How you use your plunder is also vital to your success. Players take turns in clockwise order, and on a turn you place a worker and resolve its action, then pick up a different worker and resolve its action. Broadly speaking, those actions fall in one of two categories:     Work: Having a good crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding, so before making any raids, players need to do some work to prepare their crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the village at the bottom of the game board, with eight buildings offering various actions. You must first place your worker in an available building where no other worker is present, then pick up a different worker from a different building.     Raid: Once players have hired enough crew and collected provisions, you may choose to raid on your turn. To raid a settlement — whether a harbor, outpost, monastery or fortress — you need to meet three requirements: Having a large enough crew, having enough provisions (along with gold for monasteries and fortresses, and having a worker of the right color. Raiding offers various ways of scoring, such as military strength, plunder, and Valkyries, which is how grey and white workers enter the game.The game ends when only one fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie have been removed, or all offerings have been made, then players tally their scores.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Medieval, NauticalMechanisme: Contracts, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Worker Placement, Worker Placement, Different Worker TypesMakersOntwerper: Shem Phillips]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10234-rovers-van-de-noordzee.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27704-home_default/rovers-van-de-noordzee.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10234-rovers-van-de-noordzee.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","49.95","8718026302764","WGG1914","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#251.000000}"

After all tiles have been placed, the players resolve each building in the order of who placed the most influence, with the player placing the most getting an extra benefit. There are only three places for influence in each building, so players will have to weigh their options carefully.In each round, a random mission that details which of the various items or symbols players have been collecting will give bonus victory points at the end of the round is revealed.

Tangled up with all of it is a long-dead sorceress from Arkham's past, so perhaps the best place to start is where so many witches like her met their end hundreds of years ago.—description from the publisher]]>","boardgames","17.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10333-arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-wages-of-sin-mythos-pack.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27817-home_default/arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-wages-of-sin-mythos-pack.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10333-arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-wages-of-sin-mythos-pack.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","17.95","841333107833","FFAHC31","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#124.000000}"

In the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe's powerful Stukas were a key component to the German's blitzkrieg strategy that led them to victory. Over the English Channel, the heroism of RAF pilots saved their country from an invasion. In the skies of Kursk, Smolensk and Stalingrad, many Soviet pilots defended their land against German bombs. And when the Allied forces landed in Europe, it was under a constant aerial cover of fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers. At that time, Allied air supremacy was at its pinnacle.In the Memoir '44: New Flight Plan expansion, players can deploy air units such as fighters, fighter-bombers and even bombers to support their troops on the battlefield. This is not the first time airplanes will make an appearance in the Memoir '44 system, but with its all new set of streamlined rules, Memoir '44: New Flight Plan grants many new tactical options and is compatible with all existing scenarios in all theaters of operation. The expansion also comes with 21 new scenarios and 16 finely-crafted, legendary planes, in impressive sizes, such as the B-17 that measures 72mm by 101mm.]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10334-memoir-44-new-flight-plan.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/27818-home_default/memoir-44-new-flight-plan.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10334-memoir-44-new-flight-plan.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","49.95","824968300275","DOW730027","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#892.000000}"

Each player has an identical set of tiles and plays the same tile at the same time to their own tableau, but where each player places each tile may differ.In more detail, each player creates their own world by connecting the landscapes on their tiles. Each player starts the game with the same starting tile in play. One player, the ""Leader"", shuffles their tiles face down, then removes five tiles from play without looking at them. On a turn, the Leader reveals the next tile, calls out the number on it, then everyone places that same tile somewhere in their landscape, with the adjacent edges of each pair of tiles needing to match.When the Leader draws a tile with a red number, everyone places their piece, then starting with the player who holds the God piece (initially the Leader), everyone draws a monument tile from the center of the playing area and places it on an area in their landscape. Monuments come in three colors (while the landscapes have areas in four colors), and you use only two monuments of a color for each player in the game. After placing monuments, pass the God piece clockwise to the next player.The game ends after everyone has placed their twenty tiles, then players score points based on the areas where they have monuments. Each non-purple edge of a tile has a half-circle on it; when two such edges are placed together, the owner of those tiles has created a ""cookie"" in that area. To score, you look at each area where you have a monument. If you have no half-circles in this area — that is, the area is completely enclosed — then you score 2 points for each cookie in that area. If you have any unconnected half-circles in this area, you instead score 1 point per cookie. Whoever has the most points wins!The first edition of 8bit MockUp included tiles for 2-4 players, while the second edition included tiles for 2-5 players. You can have any number of players compete in the same game as long as you have enough sets.•••ãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã¯ãç¥ãã¾ã®è¦ç¿ããã¨ãªãã ç¥ãã¾ããæç¤ºãããå°å½¢ãä¸æã«ç¹ãã¦ãç¥ãã¾ãæ°ã«å¥ãå½ãä½ãã¾ãããã®ã²ã¼ã ã¯ã¿ã¤ã«éç½®åã®ããºã«ã©ã¤ã¯ãªã²ã¼ã ã§ããã¿ã¤ã«ã®è¾ºã¨è¾ºã®è²ãåè´ããããã«éç½®ãã¦ããã20æéç½®ãããã²ã¼ã çµäºã§ããã²ã¼ã ä¸­ã«ä½åº¦ãã¢ãã¥ã¡ã³ããå»ºç¯ããã¿ã¤ãã³ã°ãç¾ãã¾ããå»ºç¯ãã¦ããå ´æã«å¿ãã¦ç¹æ°ãç²å¾ãã¦ããã¾ããè¤æ°ã»ããã®ã²ã¼ã ããããããã¨ã§æå¤§ä½äººã§ãéã¹ã¾ããAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Mythology, PuzzleMechanisme: Bingo, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Toshiki Sato]]>","boardgames","27.5","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10515-legendary-forest.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/28379-home_default/legendary-forest.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10515-legendary-forest.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","27.5","3760175515293","IEL51529","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#607.000000}"

"f1d0301f-84e4-4e51-b59f-340d020eeb15","<![CDATA[The Great City of Rome]]","<![CDATA[To rebuild the Eternal City, the Roman Emperor summoned the most talented builders of antiquity. Each of them is trying to draft the best city — but talent is not enough. Only those who know how to please the Emperor, cleverly exert their influence, and invest at the right time will succeed in City of Rome.In more detail, the game lasts fourteen rounds, and in each round, players draft one of the building cards in play and add it to their hand. The drafting order depends on how closely you stand to the emperor. At the start of a round, you reveal a new ""action strip"" that has three bricks and two cogs in some order, then players take turns placing their figure on one of these five spaces; the closer you are to the emperor, the earlier you draft, but the fewer resources (bricks and cogs) you receive. (With only two players in the game, each player places two figures on the action strip and takes two complete turns each round.)After drafting, you can take one build action and one produce action. To build, you must pay the cost in bricks — paying two coins for each missing brick — then place the card you're building adjacent to another card of yours already in play. You start with two building cards in play, so you'll have at most sixteen cards at game's end. These cards must fit in a 4x4 square, so plan carefully since you'll want to place some buildings next to other ones to earn the most points and to get the most out of a produce action. Some buildings give you a special action or influence tokens when you build them.To produce, you must have two cogs — paying one coin for each missing cog — then use the production action of each building in your city once.Every few rounds, an influence card is revealed, and whoever has the most influence tokens at the end of that round collects the card, then discards their tokens.At the end of fourteen rounds, players score points for their residential buildings, temples, aqueducts, coins, and influence cards and tokens. whoever has the most points wins!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: City Building, EnvironmentalMechanisme: Pattern BuildingMakersOntwerper: Matthew Dunstan, Brett J.

Each card is sleeved, and within the sleeve on its back is a rule explaining how this card can be swapped with another card: swap it with a red card, a card with an even number, a card with a higher number, and so on. You can look at all the rules on cards in front of you, but you cannot communicate to others what those rules are. You cannot change the order of cards in front of you.On a turn, a player must swap one of their cards (following that card's rule) with another player's card, then someone records that move on a chart. Blanks are considered to be 0 and an even number for the purpose of swaps. When one of your cards is swapped, you can look at the rule on the card you receive. You can suggest moves to others or ask questions of them, and they can respond with yes or no answers as long as they don't identify the rule on any of their cards.If you place all the numbers in numerical order (disregarding blanks) in either clockwise or counterclockwise order before you would need to make a 25th move, you all win the game. Your team's score is Great, Good, Horrible, etc. based on how many moves it took you to win. If you don't win, then you must all be worse than horrible, which is very bad indeed.In the game's expert mode, you cannot speak at all and you cannot undo a player's swap on your next turn.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-5Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, DeductionMechanisme: Communication Limits, Cooperative Game, Pattern BuildingMakersOntwerper: Daniel Fehr]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10632-narabi.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/28550-home_default/narabi.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10632-narabi.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026303167","WGG1907","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#118.000000}"

This continuation of the world's first Unique Deck Game contains 204 new cards seamlessly integrated into a card pool that contains a total of 370 different cards, creating an entirely new collection of Archon Decks for you to discover, explore, and master!The KeyForge: Age of Ascension two-player starter provides you with all the tools you need to either begin or expand your adventures on the Crucible, featuring two unique Age of Ascension Archon Decks, a Quickstart Rulebook, two Poster Playmats, and all the keys, tokens, and chain trackers you and your chosen opponent need to start playing!In more detail, KeyForge is played over a series of turns in which you, as the Archon leading your company, use the creatures, technology, artifacts, and skills of a chosen House to reap precious Æmber, hold off your enemy's forces, and forge enough keys to unlock the Crucible's Vaults. You begin your turn by declaring one of the three Houses within your deck, and for the remainder of the turn you may play and use cards only from that House. For example, if you take on the role of the Archon Radiant Argus the Supreme, you will find cards from Logos, Sanctum, and Untamed in your deck, but if you declare ""Sanctum"" at the start of your turn, you may use actions, artifacts, creatures, and upgrades only from Sanctum. Your allies from Logos and Untamed must wait.Next, you must strive to gain the advantage with a series of tactical decisions, leveraging both the cards in your hand and those in play to race ahead of your opponent. If you wish to weaken your rival's forces, you may send out your allies to fight enemies on the opposing side, matching strength against strength. Otherwise, you may choose to use your followers to reap, adding more Æmber to your pool.Notably, no card in KeyForge has a cost — choosing a House at the start of a turn allows you to play and use any number of cards from that House for free, leading turns to fly by with a wave of activity! Yet balance is key. If you simply reap more Æmber at every opportunity, your rival may quickly grow their team of minions and destroy yours, outpacing your collection and leaving your field barren.

This makes House Baratheon the most powerful House in Westeros, but it also means the Baratheons must constantly guard against the schemes of those who would threaten their throne.

But if you can unite the brothers under your command, Westeros is sure to be yours!Fury of the Storm is a deluxe expansion for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game that shines the spotlight on House Baratheon, the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms in the opening of George R.

On a turn, someone rolls the two dice, then calls out the sum. Each player either:    Writes this number in an empty space in their grid, or    Circles this number in their grid if it had been entered on any previous turn.Initially, of course, you can only write a number as you have nothing to circle. You're trying to do two things in Knaster: circle lots of numbers, and fill the rows, columns, and diagonals of your grid with ""scoring combinations"" of numbers, i.e., three- to five-of-a-kind, two pairs, a full house, or a straight. When you place five numbers in a row, column, or diagonal and you have created one of these scoring combinations, then you immediately circle 1-3 numbers in this same line. If all the numbers in a line are circled, you can then circle the number (5-10) outside the grid that's next to this line.As soon as someone fills in the 25th space in the grid, they let everyone know this, then after one final turn, the game ends.

Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their buses), and (3) the districts that they've connected.

Each of the two empty spaces of each boat are then filled with two identical merchandise tokens, with the game including twenty types of merchandise. Each player starts the game with an objective card showing four different types of merchandise.On a turn, the active player rolls the dice to determine how many actions they can take; they can spend 1-2 coins to add to this number of actions. Actions are: Slide a boat: You can move a boat any number of unoccupied spaces either forward or backward; a boat cannot move sideways. Rotate a boat: You can rotate a boat 90 around its sailor through unoccupied spaces. Move your figure: You can move your figure one space from a pontoon to a space on the boat that's empty or occupied by merchandise tokens or from one boat space to another or from a boat to a pontoon; you cannot move your figure over a sailor. When you move your figure onto a merchandise token showing on your objective card, you can pick it up.If you don't spend all of your actions, take coins equal to the number of unspent actions to bank them for later. As soon as you have all of the merchandise needed for your objective card, return to your pontoon. Once you do, you draw a second objective card, and whoever completes two objective cards first wins.Dragon Market also contains advanced objective cards that show 3-4 types of merchandise as well as a bonus. At the start of the game, each player draws two cards and keeps one of them. As soon as the player returns to their pontoon with the depicted goods, they reveal this objective card, then have access to this bonus, which provides either a one-time effect or an effect that can be used once each turn. They also draw two new objective cards and keep one of them.

(Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!)To set up play, lay out 25 word cards in a 5×5 grid. Place a key card in the holder so that each player sees one side of the card. Each player sees a 5×5 grid on the card, with nine of the squares colored green (representing your agents) and three squares colored black (representing assassins). Three of the nine squares on each side are also green on the other side, one assassin is black on both sides, one is green on the other side and the other is an innocent bystander on the other side.Collectively, you need to reveal all fifteen agents — without revealing an assassin — before time runs out in order to win the game. Either player can decide to give the first one-word clue to the other player, along with a number. Whoever receives the clue places a finger on a card to identify that agent. If correct, they can attempt to identify another one. If they identify a bystander, then their guessing time ends. If they identify an assassin, you both lose! Unlike regular Codenames, they can keep guessing as long as they keep identifying an agent each time; this is useful for going back to previous clues and finding ones they missed earlier.

On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white tokens for one black token at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one token (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.The game ends at the end of the round where at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins!The original title of this game is a German acronym and stands for Lege alle Minuspunkte ab, that is, discard all minus points, with Lama also being the German spelling of llama.The Polish game Lato z Komarami features gameplay nearly identical to LLAMA except that the game has one less llama card, and the penalty for llama cards in hand is 10 points per card, instead of being 10 points for one or more llama cards.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, NumberMechanisme: Hand Management, Ladder Climbing, Matching, Push Your LuckMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10822-lama.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/28756-home_default/lama.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/10822-lama.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8719214426941","999-LAM01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#170.000000}"

Breaches in reality begin to rip through the fabric of the Earth, and a faint melody of discordant pipes can be heard throughout the streets of Arkham. Frightened citizens have sealed themselves in their homes, yet you continue to patrol the streets, desperate for some solution to end the chaos.In In the Clutches of Chaos, doom does not accrue at the usual rate. Instead, breaches are made at various locations, marked by resource tokens. When enough breaches have been made a single location, an incursion occurs. An incursion adds doom to its location and causes the breaches to spread, opening rifts in reality at connecting locations. Your goal is to prevent incursions by removing the breaches that cause them, but this can only be done by activating the action abilities on each location.

Players in The Color Monster collaborate to help the Monster figure out his emotions. In turns, they roll the die that allows them to move the Monster around the board. When the Monster goes to a space with an emotion token, the player can pick it up and look for the right jar. The jars are all placed on shelves with their colors hidden. If the player chooses the jar which matches the color of the emotion, then they can place the emotion token into the jar. Otherwise, the jar goes back to the shelf as it was. In order to pick up an emotion token, players have to explain a memory or a situation in which they feel like the emotion they are picking up (Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Fear or Calm). The players can lose the game if the Monster gets too confused and they flip over too many mixed emotion jars, or win the game when the emotions are all placed in their correct jars.

The game ends when a player reaches the point limit.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-7Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Animals, Children's Game, DiceMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Push Your Luck, Re-rolling and LockingMakersOntwerper: Markus Kropf]]>","boardgames","15.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11121-konijnen-hokken.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/29214-home_default/konijnen-hokken.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11121-konijnen-hokken.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","15.95","8717249193173","999-KON01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#150.000000}"

Time to travel once again to distant locations, but in Lost Cities: Rivals you might find yourself running short of cash to take the trips you want!
Lost Cities: Rivals features gameplay familiar from other titles in the Lost Cities series. Players will collect colored expedition cards and place them in ascending order in personal expeditions, possibly placing wager cards before beginning an expedition in order to increase its value. The primary difference in this title compared to others is that you must win auctions in order to place cards in your expeditions.
The card deck consists of (in each of the five colors) three wager cards, two copies of cards numbered 2-5, and one copy of cards numbered 6-10; shuffle this deck, then divide it into four piles, keeping only one pile in front of players for now. From a separate deck, each player is given two differently colored wager cards at the start of play. A bank of 36 coins is divided equally among the players.
On a turn, you can either reveal the top card from the current pile (adding it to the display) or auction the cards on display. In the auction, you must raise or pass, and once only a single person remains in the auction, they pay the amount bid to the center of the table, then take any cards that they want to play and start or add to expeditions. Placing the same number in an expedition is okay. The auction winner can also place one card from the display in the box out of play. The auction winner ends their turn by adding a card to the display.
When the final card of a pile is revealed, divide all the coins in the center of the table equally among all players, then bring in a new pile to continue play. Once the final card of the final pile is revealed, the game ends immediately with no distribution of coins. For each expedition, a player scores the number of footprints on the numbered cards. If they have a wager in that color, they double that value; if two wagers, they triple it; etc. A player also scores 1 point for each gold coin they hold and 8 points for each expedition that contains at least four number cards. Whoever has the highest total wins!

With the help of your supporters, keep your Governor safe as you seek to outmaneuver your opponent in this card-based game of bluff and deduction.Each player controls a set of 10 cards representing the Governors constituents (or unscrupulous individuals in it for the gold), each with a different ability. These characters are lined up facing one another, their identities hidden from their opponent. During the game, the characters will move up and down the table, revealing their identity to collect tokens and use their abilities.Players must cleverly manage the information that they obtain and reveal, baiting and trapping their opponent to accomplish one of the three win conditions. The first player to do so will attain the power and glory of the White House, leaving his opponent with only the taste of bitter defeat.There are three ways to win the game:    The Good way: Win the election fair and square. Some of the facedown tokens are votes that you can use to get your Governor elected. If you have more votes than your opponent, then you can use your Governor to start an election and win the game.    The Bad way: If you can find your opponents Governor and assassinate him with your Hitman, you can win the election by default. A dead man cant be President, its as simple as that.    The Ugly Way: If you suspect that your opponent is after your Governor, you can attempt to arrest them with your Sheriff. If a Sheriff can foil an assassination attempt and arrest the Hitman, his employers reputation will be left in tatters. A scandal will destroy a man just as surely as a bullet... Your objective is to hide your Governor amongst your other cards whilst you search for a way to win the game. You and your opponent will be able to look at each others cards, move them around, and even lock some of them up! Youll need to use as much deception and bluff as you can to win because, whether it be by silver or lead, only one of you will make it out of this unscathed!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: American West, Bluffing, DeductionMechanisme: MakersOntwerper: Jérémy Pinget]]>","boardgames","14.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11123-outlaws-last-man-standing.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/29216-home_default/outlaws-last-man-standing.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11123-outlaws-last-man-standing.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","14.95","8719214425739","999-OUT01-uitloop","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#612.000000}"

Colored sand is laid to create a symbolic map of the world before the pattern is ceremonially destroyed and the sand cast into the river.In the two-player game Mandala, you are trying to score more than your opponent by collecting valuable cards  but you won't know which cards are valuable until well into the game! Over the course of the game, players play their colored cards into the two mandalas, building the central shared mountains and laying cards into their own fields. As soon as a mandala has all six colors, the players take turns choosing the colors in the mountain and adding those cards to their river and cup. At the end of the game, the cards in your cup are worth points based on the position of their colors in that player's river. The player whose cup is worth more points wins.The linen playmat shows two circular mandalas, with each being divided by a horizontal space (the mountain) to create one field for each player. The playmat has seven spaces in front of each player to hold their river of single face-up cards and their cup: the stack of face-down cards which they score at the end of the game.To begin, each player receives a hand of six cards. Each player receives two random cards face down in their cup, then two random cards are dealt face up into the central mountain strip of each mandala.On your turn, you may play either a single card into one of mountains, or one or more matching cards into one of your fields. All cards played into a mandala must follow the Rule of Color: Once a color has been played into one of the three areas of a mandala, then later cards of the same color can be played only into that same area. Thus, once your opponent has played red cards into their field, then you can't play red cards in your field, and neither you nor your opponent can play red cards into the central mountain. If you played a card into a mountain, draw three new cards from the deck at the end of your turn; if you played cards into one of your fields, do not draw new cards.A mandala is completed once it contains all six colors of cards. When this happens, the players destroy the mandala, taking turns to choose a color present in the mountain and claim all cards of that color. Whoever played more cards in their field chooses first; if tied, the player who did not complete the mandala chooses first. The first time you claim cards of a specific color, lay one of these cards in the lowest-valued empty space in your river, then place the rest into your cup. The spaces in your river are valued 1-6 in order, so cards of the first color you claim will be worth 1 point each, cards of the second color you claim worth 2 points each, and so on.Once a mandala has been destroyed and all the colors in the mountain claimed, cards played in the fields are discarded, two new cards are dealt face up into the mountain, and the game continues.The end of the game is triggered either when the deck is exhausted or when one player adds a sixth color to their river. Both players then tally the value of all the cards in their cup, based on the position of the colors in their river, and whoever has the higher score wins!Contents:     1 linen playmat     108 mandala cards (18 in each of 6 colours)     2 reference cardsAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Abstract Strategy, Card GameMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Hand Management, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Trevor Benjamin, Brett J.

Come, Mage, and see your destiny!
Deep in the Forest of Argos, the struggle rages on between the Kingdom’s most powerful sorcerers, each convinced of their glorious destiny.Making their burning desire a reality will require bravery and determination. However, destiny is a fickle mistress...Play with 20 new Power cards (2 copies of each card) like the dangerous Argosian Tangleweed, the powerful Chalice of Eternity or the mysterious Sepulchral Amulet!
There are new cards with abilities modifying the core of the game in interesting ways, like blocking someone else's familiar, rerolling the die not chosen by any player or straigthening once-used card (for 1 crystal) to use it again this turn. The main power of this expansion lies in the concept of the Die of Destiny.Once per round, a player can take a die from the menu as usual, but instead of applying its effects, roll a Die of Destiny. The bonuses from this die are generally weaker than those of seasons dice, but it gives the players certain number of destiny tokens. Whoever has most tokens by the end gets +20 prestige (in other words, whoever relied the least on the stronger, seasons dice).
This expansion is independent on the first one (Seasons: Enchanted Kingdom) and adds more variability and some new concepts to your plays.
Only for the first edition of Seasons: Path of Destiny, discover a special promo card: Igramul the Banisher! The effect of this card was created by Federico Latini during the Seasons: Path of Destiny contest in September 2013.

Of course each of them wants to make the biggest catch, but they're discovering that this isn't so easy. Only the one who moves across the ice floes with foresight, breaks open the ice at the right spots, and guides the fishing rod skillfully, will be able to get the desired fish out of the water!In Kayanak, players punch holes through the ""ice"" (a sheet of paper) to try to catch fish, which are represented by steel balls of various sizes. In the basic game, the first player to catch ten fish wins.

In the village of Tiefenthal lies ""The Tavern of the Deep Valley"". There, all citizens from the area gather, but it's important to attract new, wealthy guests for only then is there enough money to expand the tavern, which will then lure nobles into the tavern as well. But which tavern expansion is best? Should you focus on money? Or rather ensure that the beer will keep flowing?
In The Taverns of Tiefenthal, the challenge is to skillfully choose the dice and develop your personal deck of cards as profitably as possible. The game is structured with five modules so that your group can add extra levels of complexity as you become more familiar with the game.

The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  Nederlands, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Animals, Card Game, EconomicMechanisme: Hand Management, Hidden Victory Points, Market, Open Drafting, Score-and-Reset Game, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Sébastien Pauchon]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11414-jaipur-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/29623-home_default/jaipur-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11414-jaipur-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Space Cowboys]]","19.95","3558380063841","SPC16-001","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#378.000000}"

With water as a new element, the tribe has more flexibility in how it will extend itself. More specifically, in the game water functions like a joker, e.g., you can swap two water tokens for any one goods token. Many of the new tribe cards, which replace the set in the base game, allow players to choose to spend gold or water tokens, which can make it a little easier to build.The Targia — a Tuareg woman — is a special pawn like the robber, but has a more positive effect for players. She starts in the opposite direction of the robber and moves each turn one edge card. When you place one of your Targi on the same card, you receive a favor: Either take a goods token of your choice or spend one good to reveal the top card from the draw pile and receive what it shows. Now a less attractive edge card might be more interesting because the Targia offers an additional reward.Finally, shifting sand cards give the players rather strong immediate advantages when they place a Targi on them — but since these shifting sands are placed next to the central playing area, you lose an intersection on the central cards.]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11539-targi-de-uitbreiding.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/29739-home_default/targi-de-uitbreiding.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11539-targi-de-uitbreiding.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","19.95","8718026303648","WGG1960","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#366.000000}"

Regardless, the King is dead without any known heirs, so it's up to the five factions of the realm to decide who will be the new king: Will it be you or your opponent? Do you have what it takes to win over the realm's factions?Claim 2 is played in two distinct phases. In phase one, each player gets a hand of cards that they use to recruit followers. In phase two, they use the followers from phase one to compete and win over the five factions of the realms. Each faction has a special power that effects play, and powers can be different in each phase! At the end of the game, the player who has the majority of followers of a faction wins that faction's vote, and whoever wins the vote of at least three factions wins the game!Claim 2 is a standalone sequel to Claim, featuring five new factions that can be played on their own or mixed in any combination with the factions in Claim.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 25 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, FantasyMechanisme: Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Scott Almes]]>","boardgames","7.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11637-claim-2-pocket.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/29803-home_default/claim-2-pocket.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11637-claim-2-pocket.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","7.95","8718026303679","WGG1908","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#82.000000}"

His final wish was that his descendants would share his fortune and the plots of his ranch, with the richest becoming the new head of the family. After all, for him the most important thing was that his money stayed in the family! Pappy thought of everything and left an outline of his belongings. In Pappy Winchester, you and the other heirs are now assembled around this map to divvy up Pappy's possessions...The game board features 19 plots of land, divided into seven desert plots, six prairie plots, and six forest plots, with train tracks and a river running crossways through the land, and a saloon set apart from everything else. To set up play, give each player $8,000 and two secret objective cards, then place a bonus token face down on each plot of land.On a turn, the active player draws a plot token at random, then players hold an auction for that plot, with the winner marking it with one of their tokens, then revealing the bonus token and carrying out its effects. This token might let you look at the face-down mine or ranch cards to determine the value of those plots; move the train or boat along the tracks or river, with players owning properties adjacent to this vehicle's location earning money; or collect funds from the saloon. The winner of the auction then divides their bid as equally as possible among all other players, with any remainder being placed on the saloon.Each player starts the game with a duel token, and when a player is involved in an auction that's down to them and someone else, they can decide to sped that token. If they do, a third player shuffles two duel cards  one showing a gun being fired, and the other not  then each bidder takes one of them, with the player holding the firing gun winning the auction.Five piles of banknotes are laid out at the start of play, with a different shared objective card placed on each pile. If the completion of an auction allows a player to meet one or more of the objectives, such as owning one of each type of land or having three plots that don't touch the river, then that player claims the banknotes under that card. After the 19th auction, players reveal their secret objectives, earning money for how well they've met those goals, and whoever owns the most plots of land receives $5,000.

It includes sixty challenge cards and sixteen insect tokens, four each of four types. To complete a challenge, you lay out the insects as shown on the challenge card, then place the chameleon token adjacent to one edge of the grid. A move consists of eating (i.e., flipping face down) all the insects of one type in the row/column next to the chameleon, then advancing the chameleon clockwise around the perimeter as many spaces as the number of insects you just ate. If you land on a row/column with no uneaten insects  yet insects remain elsewhere in the layout  then you've lost the challenge; if you eat all the insects, you win.Kameleo can also be played as a two-player game. Lay out the insects on a challenge card, then the first player chooses where to place the chameleon token. Players take turns eating a type of insect and moving the chameleon.

To claim such a route, discard a number of cards equal to the length of the route with all the card being the same color, then mark the route with a single Bullet Train miniature; instead of scoring points for such a route, advance your marker on the separate Bullet Train track as many spaces as the length of this route. At the end of the game, whoever has contributed the most to this shared project receives the largest bonus, with the player who contributes least being penalized.This game board also has a small inlay for the Tokyo subway system, so players are effectively working on two networks at once. You might have a ticket that lists a city outside Tokyo and a station with Tokyo, and you need to complete a route from that other city to Tokyo, then from the central Tokyo station to that particular subway station.In Italy, the game board is divided into regions, and players score bonus points based on how many regions they connect in their network, with three regions — Sardegna, Sicilia, and Puglia — counting as two regions in your tally. If you have separate networks, then you score each one separately.The board also introduces a new type of ferry route. On this game board, all gray routes are ferry routes, with these routes having 1-4 spaces marked with a wave symbol. To cover a wave symbol, you must play a locomotive or a ferry card from your hand (in addition to the other cards needed to claim this route); a ferry card is a special type of card that can be drafted on its own on your turn, and it contains two wave symbols, so it can be used on its own to cover two symbols on a route.The player trains and game cards from Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe are needed to play this expansion.]]>","boardgames","39.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11833-ticket-to-ride-map-collection-volume-7-japan-italy.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/30098-home_default/ticket-to-ride-map-collection-volume-7-japan-italy.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/11833-ticket-to-ride-map-collection-volume-7-japan-italy.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","39.95","824968201329","DOW 720132","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1452.000000}"

A sheet in the center of the playing area shows various polyomino tiles in those same five colors, with tiles of two and three spaces on one side of a central divider and tiles of four and five spaces on the other side. The game includes five six-sided dice that feature the above mentioned five colors on five of their sides as well as a sixth color that serves as a joker. Each player starts with two red stars on their scoresheet; you can spend one of these stars on your turn to reroll as many dice as you wish.On a turn, you roll the five dice. If you have rerolls in reserve, you can use them if you wish. You then choose a group of dice in a single color, then you see the shape of the polyomino that corresponds to this choice, then you draw that polyomino on the facade of the building, with the polyomino needing to rest on the bottom of the building area. One space in this polyomino is brick (represented by an X) while the other spaces are all windows (represented by an O). If you created a polyomino of four or five spaces, you cross it off the central sheet of paper as each tile shown on the right side of the sheet can be used only once.Each other player then gets to choose one of the dice that you didn't use to claim that polyomino, then fill in the leftmost empty box of that color on their scoresheet. These boxes might have a symbol underneath them. If the box has a + under it, then this player can cross off the + on a future turn to add one phantom die showing this color to whatever they rolled that round, e.g., if you cross off a blue +, you effectively rolled three blue dice that turn instead of two. If a box has a star under it, then you can cross out that star on a future turn to use the power of that color:    Red lets you reroll as many dice as you want.    Blue lets you change one brick space to a window space when you're drawing something into your facade.    Purple lets you draw one brick space in an empty space of your choice (as long as this space isn't floating in air).    Green lets you change all dice of one color to another color of your choice.    Yellow lets you use a polyomino shape that was crossed out on a previous turn.You can use as many stars as you wish on your turn.When you fill in a horizontal row in the facade of your building, you score 2 points if all the spaces are filled with windows and 1 point if at least one space holds brick; when you fill in a vertical column, you score 4 points and 2 points under the same condition. When you fill in predesignated rows and columns, you receive an immediate bonus  either drawing one window in an empty space or crossing off two boxes in one or two color lines on your scoresheet. If you cross out the final space in a color line, you score 2 points.Gameplay continues until someone has scored 12 or more points.

Summon Creatures: Take new creature cards from the display by playing the appropriate amount of spell power from cards in your hand.2.

The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.The game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.The clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter.  At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word.

Or maybe you prefer to take a walk through the charming streets of Wroclaw?Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 6  Poland, which debuted solely on the Polish market in 2019 as Wsi do Pocigu: Polska, challenges players to create connections between Poland's neighboring countries, such as Germany, Ukraine, and the Czech Republic. In addition to connecting cities and completing tickets in the usual way of other Ticket to Ride games, your routes can reach border crossings and thus connect neighboring countries. If you manage to create such a connection on your turn, say, building a track so that you have a connected line from Ukraine to Germany, you draw the top point card from the stack for each of these two countries. Their point value is arranged in descending order, which means that the players who are the first to draw cards receive more points. If you later connect this network to the Czech Republic, then you'd draw the top card from each of the three countries' card stacks  assuming that a country's cards haven't all been claimed, of course.]]>","boardgames","34","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/12216-ticket-to-ride-polska.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/30493-home_default/ticket-to-ride-polska.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/12216-ticket-to-ride-polska.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Days of Wonder]]","34","824968201305","DOW 720130","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#804.000000}"

Maybe they'll find planets with good ore or carbon deposits  or perhaps only barren ice planets. They might encounter alien folks and start lucrative trading, with pirates and wormholes being a constant challenge for them.Catan: Starfarers is a new version of Starfarers of Catan, originally released in 1999, that contains completely revised graphics and game materials, revised rules, and (most importantly) a variable game board that brings even more variety to the exploration of space.Changes to the mechanics include-If you are lower in the points you get cards on your turn regardless of what you roll. Two random cards initially, then one, then none as your victory points go up. This is a nice touch. No matter how unlucky you are you still get something. Plus if a player rolls a seven, the person can take a card from any other player, but their opponents now draw a random card from the deck.- Market Trades: Since you have no roads you no longer need ports so, since you no longer have ports you can trade with the market for any resource on your turn; provided you have the right cards. Additionally the ratios aren't bad, Any resource for 3:1, i.e. three of one for one of any other type. Goods (a type of resource) trades for 2:1. This plus no road blocking allows you to trade for resources and keep playing.- There are NPC races that can give you benefits, some of which are +1 resources whenever you get a resource of the same type. But you have to get there early. Now there is a new dynamic to the game, going out into space becomes a strategy on its own.- Negotiated trades: Since the resources are more readily available there are less negotiated trades. They still exist and someone can still trade 1:1, 3:1, etc... but it is no longer a singularly driving force in the game. Unless you have a big move and you're missing that one card.- Resource (set collection) becomes part of your strategy without being limited to negotiation and luck of the die. I think this actually works better.Colonization: You colonize to claim planets in a system. This is the same as building towns in Catan. But how many can be in a system (hex) depends on player count. In a three player game you're only allowed two colonies per system. In a four player game each system only holds up to three players colonies.  If you got blocked out early from the closest systems, reach further into the stars to other systems. Who knows you might meet pirate and you'll have to fight, or traders, perhaps a race of Travelers who will open a worm hole to anywhere on the map.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-4Speelduur: 120 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Exploration, Negotiation, Science Fiction, Space ExplorationMechanisme: Hexagon Grid, Modular Board, Trading, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: Klaus Teuber]]>","boardgames","89.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/12593-catan-kosmonauten.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/30858-home_default/catan-kosmonauten.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/12593-catan-kosmonauten.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","89.95","8719214427528","999-KOL50","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2540.000000}"

"b297bb57-cc16-46be-b347-627e35d50827","<![CDATA[Gang of Four]]","<![CDATA[Gang of Four™ is an exciting game of Cunning, Strategy and Power. The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.HistoryThe term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.What's in the box?Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.comGameplayAll the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored ""1"" card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands.

Western Empires can take up to 12 hours to complete, and still yet, it has a simple mechanism and is easy to learn. The players lead their civilizations, as they expand and collapse, from the Stone Age, through the Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age. Western Empires provides a full day of fun for larger groups.Though it may seem at first glance, Western Empires is not a wargame. Yes, conflict may be involved, but rather it is a game about history, culture, trade, development, and... calamities. The civilizations involved are all situated around the Mediterrainean Sea. The Romans, The Egyptians, The Celts and The Minoans. Players develop their own unique civilization in arts, crafts, science, civics and religion. Each player starts his civilization with a single population token, 8000 BC, but grows and grows over time, and eventually cities can be built. Cities of course bring wealth and fortune, but also natural calamities such as epidemics, famine or earthquakes, or civil calamities such as pirate attacks, slave revolts and civil disorder.This wealth is expressed in trade cards. The more cities, the more cards a player gets. These cards provide both trading commodities, and calamities. Trading is the heart of the game. Develop religion, democracy, improve science 51 different advances can be developed in five different categories.Maybe a player can even construct a wonder of the world, or scatter their people all over the map, and gain cultural ascendancy. The player that knows best how to work together, trade or battle for territory, defend his people against nature or enemies like barbarian hordes, and stand the test of time, eventually will win the game. After up to 12 hours of playing that is. The game can be expanded with Western Empires: The Special Buildings Expansion (2019).When combining the board games Western Empires (2019) and Eastern Empires (2021) this forms: Mega Empires (2021), an 18-player experience. A full game of Mega Empires takes up to 13 hours to complete. This bundle contains both stand alone games, each of which can be played by 3-9 players and can be expanded with the two Special Buildings Expansions (2019) for either game or the combination of both games. Where Western Empires has a focus on sea travel and trade on the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Empires follows the Silk Road to India and trading is done through the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.description from the designersAlgemeenAantal spelers: 5-9Speelduur: 180 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Ancient, Civilization, Economic, Mythology, Nautical, Pirates, PoliticalMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Area Movement, Betting and Bluffing, Hand Management, Memory, Negotiation, Real-Time, Set Collection, Take That, Trading, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Flo de Haan, Gerart de Haan, John Rodriguez, Francis Tresham]]>","boardgames","119.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13014-western-empires.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31273-home_default/western-empires.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13014-western-empires.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","119.95","8719214427313","999-WES01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#4750.000000}"

I think that only TS enthusiasts have already taken the time to read mission returns on the SpaceCowboys website, a sort of debriefing with your BOB instructor summarizing the mission accomplished in more detail, while preparing you for the next one.Because TS scenarios do not have an imposed order, you can discover pieces of the main story in a timeline that belongs to you. ""Experience"" aims to embed and enrich the content of this blue cycle. You can discover more details about the environment where you live or customize your agents.This last point leaves me pensive ... Can one envisage a system of progression of the heroes in the form of experience, of cosmetics as in the video games, or then in a narrative frame retracing multiple choice paths, like a book of which you are the hero ?The SpaceCowboys' thinking around this ""Experience"" box is to allow players to appropriate the adventure of Time Travelers as they see fit.If you are inspired and attracted to the theme of a particular scenario, you can dive as usual, discover its secrets and mysteries, experience a thrilling adventure and tidy the box. The unique use remains within the reach of those who feel closer to the theme of a scenario than the history of the game.With ""Experience"", it is rather the players eager to deepen their knowledge of the Lore of TS, its characters, history in the stories, which are targeted.The best part of all this is that the box ""Experience"" seems to be able to adapt to our progress when we decide to use it, regardless of the order of the scenarios already played or the one from which we go. get it.—description from the publisher]]>","boardgames","23.5","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13015-time-stories-revolution-experience.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31274-home_default/time-stories-revolution-experience.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13015-time-stories-revolution-experience.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Space Cowboys]]","23.5","3558380066354","SPC02-100","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#450.000000}"

In the game, players are secretly assigned a role which is either a terrorist or a SWAT officer. Then cards are dealt to each player. They look at their cards and randomly place the cards face-down in front of them. SWATs win together if they deactivate the time bomb by revealing all of the SUCCESS cards.
Each turn, a player chooses a card in front of another player and reveal it. If it is a SUCCESS card, SWATs get closer to winning. Otherwise it is a threat card, and its threat effect is activated according to its color. Terrorists win together if four threats of the same color are revealed.
Players may discuss whose card should be revealed, but they should be noted that terrorists may be misleading SWATs.

As you are chased by your fate across the cosmos, you may be forced to bring empty space into play, losing the top card of your deck as you place it facedown to embody the seemingly infinite space that divides you from the rest of humanity. This is not a location; it cannot be entered or investigated, and the only way to reclaim your lost card is to fill the empty space with a Cosmos location. These impossible places, drawn from the new Cosmos deck, do not have set places they must connect to. Rather, each Cosmos card has a connecting instruction you must obey in order to place it.

Each part has a number from 1-6 and the roll of a die decides which kind of body part you can take from the pool. The goal is then to complete as many clowns as possible.Jumbolino is representative of a whole class of children's games where players roll a die and add a puzzle piece to their board for the number on the die roll. Similar to Cootie, except that Cootie requires you to get multiples of some numbers (6 ea. of 6 for the legs, and 2 ea. of 4 and 3 for eyes and antennae).It's also similar to The Merry Game of Floundering, with some differences. In The Merry Game of Floundering:1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the center even if fully assembled.4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the center and if there are none in the center that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.Similar to Safari Builders, but Safari Builders is listed as 1-4 players.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 4+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Animals, Children's Game, Movies / TV / Radio theme, PuzzleMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Pattern RecognitionMakersOntwerper: (Uncredited)]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13392-jumbolino.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31668-home_default/jumbolino.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13392-jumbolino.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Jumbo]]","12.95","8710126197042","Jum-19704","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#290.000000}"

You can do so only as a real team! In more detail, to win you must play all fifty cards in the deck on the two discard piles. The deck consists of fifty cards, with cards coming in five colors numbered 1-10 in each color. Each player has a hand of two cards.On a turn, you play one or two cards onto one or both of the two discard piles. On one pile, you must play a higher card that whatever the top card is, and on the other, you must play a lower card. The exception is that you can play any card on a discard pile if it's the same color as the current top card. Thus, on the ascending discard pile the cards played might be blue 1, red 2, gray 4, yellow 6, yellow 2  and that drop down gives you breathing room in which to play more cards.You can't reveal the specific numbers you have in hand, but you can say things like, I have a high yellow card. In the professional version of the game, you must play exactly one card each turn (even if you want to play two), and you can reveal only the color of cards in your hand and on which stack you want to play.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 8 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, NumberMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Hand ManagementMakersOntwerper: Steffen Benndorf]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13412-the-game-quick-easy.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31688-home_default/the-game-quick-easy.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13412-the-game-quick-easy.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026304119","WGG2043","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#138.000000}"

Now, the two candidates must battle for control of the planets to determine who deserves the right to become a Certified Civilization.Cosmic Encounter Duel is a competitive standalone two-player game in the Cosmic Encounter universe in which you and your closest frenemy race to be the first to control five planets. Each of twenty-seven alien species comes equipped with its own unique abilities that play with the game mechanisms in some way, offering you an edge in the fight, e.g., the Cheater, who can reserve an additional tactic that they can put toward any fight in the game  as long as their opponent doesn't call out how they're trying to cheat. How your game of Cosmic Encounter Duel plays out will inevitably be affected by which powers each dueling species has and how they play off of one another.In addition to your unique species and its ability, you have twenty spaceships to traverse the cosmos and maintain control over the five planets you need to become a Certified Civilization. As long as you have a ship on a planet, you have control of it, even if your opponent also has ships there and you must share control. You can deploy these ships to fight in duels, use them to act as reinforcements, or draw them back for a tactful retreat. Just don't lose them to the Warp or let them be claimed by the black void between the stars and end up lost in space forever!To play, players draw and resolve Destiny cards, which come in three types: Discovery cards, Event cards, and Refresh cards. Discovery cards have you and your opponent discover a planet and duel for control, while Event cards ask you both to test your mettle against a variety of challenges and cosmic calamities, and Refresh cards offer a respite in which you can recover ships, gather allies, and ultimately prepare for another clash.At the start of a duel, you and your opponent secretly decide how many ships to send to the planet, and once they have been deployed, you can call upon any befriended envoys. To plan your attack, you secretly choose a card from your hand and a standing tactic from your collection to either guard your ships or blast your opponent's ships, then you fight, sending ships to face-off for control of the planet until the winner claims their prize while the loser retreats. After you and your opponent resolve a Destiny card, you check the icon on the bottom of the card to determine which deck to draw from next, then the race continues.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Bluffing, Card Game, Science Fiction, Space ExplorationMechanisme: Hand Management, Race, Simultaneous Action Selection, Take That, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Frank Brooks, Bill Eberle, Peter Olotka, Greg Olotka]]>","boardgames","44.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13415-cosmic-encounter-duel.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31691-home_default/cosmic-encounter-duel.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13415-cosmic-encounter-duel.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","44.95","841333111076","FFCED01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#810.000000}"

He absolutely needs a place of solace where he can relax and recover. A beautiful garden filled with paths, statues, and flora is just what he needs.In Zen Garden, the players assume the role of architects working to build the most beautiful garden for the Emperor. To do this, they need to pay careful attention to the Emperor's preferences, while trying to stay one step ahead of the competition.A turn in Zen Garden is simple: The first player selects one tile from the selection board, pays its cost, then adds it to their garden adjacent to a previously placed tile. Each player does this, then the board is refilled and a new starting player begins the next turn.Zen Garden comes with five preference boards that determine which features of the garden score in that game. The boards selected (and their number) will greatly change the objectives players will strive for in that game.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: Mechanisme: End Game Bonuses, Pattern Building, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Mike Georgiou]]>","boardgames","44.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13567-zen-garden.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/31853-home_default/zen-garden.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13567-zen-garden.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","44.95","4010350105023","QUE-10502","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1791.000000}"

Beautiful, glowing swarms of fireflies may be released only from the highest towering platforms in the city during the upcoming summer solstice. Six different guilds reside in the city, and they will do everything possible to build their own tree as high as possible in each district. As chief of your district, each round you decide which guild you want to support in your part of the city as you want to lure the spectators to your show on festival day and to send as many brightly-glowing fireflies to freedom as possible.In game terms, the guilds are represented by a deck of 108 cards, with each of the six guilds appearing 18 times. To set up, deal three cards face up to each player, grouping those cards in columns by color. Lay out five cards face up to form the market. Place the game-ending firefly festival card twenty cards up from the bottom of the deck.On a turn, a player takes all the cards of one color from the market or one card of each color that appears only once in the market; they then add these cards to their collection. If you already have cards of that color, you place the new cards upward in a column so that everyone can see how many cards you have; if you don't have this color, place cards of the new color to the left or right of your current columns. Then refill the market. When the firefly festival card is revealed, end the game after each player has taken the same number of cards.To score, look at each column of cards in your collection and compare the number of cards in it to the number of cards in the columns to the left and right. (For the columns on the outer edge of your collection, you compare their height to the height of your neighbor's closest column and the adjoining column in your collection.) For each column, if it's at least as tall as each column adjacent to it, you score points equal to the number of cards in that column.

These bonuses include war chests, armies placed directly into the tower tray, rice and victory points.With Military Leaders, every player is given one military leader figure to place on one of their controlled provinces. A player's leader provides extra benefits for performing actions in their province, such as reducing the cost for buildings or providing extra resources when collecting rice or taxes. At the end of a player's turn, they move their leader to an adjacent province they control and leave a marker at the old location - if they don't control any provinces adjacent to where their leader is, they move their leader to any of their controlled provinces without leaving a marker behind. The more markers a player has on the board at the end of the game, the more points will be awarded!For Chambers, many offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. At the beginning of each round, six chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau, representing available offices that can be filled by the players.

You put on your jacket, lace up your boots and set out.The leaves rustle on the trees, and the sunlight shines through the branches. A gentle breeze blows as you take a deep breath of forest air. Lost in your thoughts, you turn once here and then again there, sometimes going left and sometimes turning right... Suddenly you hear something rustling behind you in the bushes. You take a few cautious steps towards the noise and discover...a goose?! And it's talking to a goblin? Then all of a sudden, your friends are standing next to you in the forest...Umm. You decide it might best to head home quickly. There seems to be something wrong with this forest...Which is the shortest way back? You're in luck as the fairy tale characters decide to show you, but your friends are constantly changing the path in Memorinth in their own attempts to get home the quickest. However, with a bit of luck and memory, you'll be the first to get out of the labyrinth!To set up, place the clearing tile on the table, then place all of the player pieces on this card, then lay out the other tile to form a 5x5 grid with the clearing tile at the center; alternate the light and dark sides of the tiles, with the clearing tile starting on the light side. Place two of the eight fairy tale characters on each side of the grid.On a turn, a player flips over an unoccupied tile that matches the light/dark status of the clearing tile. If the revealed side of the tile has one of the eight fairy tail characters on it, you must move your player piece one space toward the side of the grid where this character is located  but only if a path connects the tile you current occupy and the tile to which you must move. If no path exists, you don't move. Starting with the second round, the clearing tile will flip from light to dark and back again, challenging you to remember which characters are where so that you can move in the direction that helps you best.Memorinth also has a master mode in which you place four of the fairy tail characters around a special double-sided action tile. On one side of this tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll remove a tile from the grid, then add it back on the opposite side of the grid, sliding everything in that row or column. On the other side of the action tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll swap two tiles, swap two fairy tail characters, look at the bottom of a tile, or receive a lucky clover token, which you'll need in order to walk on a path with goblins.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 6+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Maze, MemoryMechanisme: Follow, Memory, Modular Board, RaceMakersOntwerper: Richi Haarhoff]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13883-memorinth.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/32229-home_default/memorinth.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/13883-memorinth.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","19.95","8718026304225","WGG2055","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#288.000000}"

Amsterdam is the beating heart of global trade and the wealthiest city on Earth. Goods from around the world are piling up on the docks, in ship holds, in warehouses, and on the banks of its countless canals. You mean to profit from this!Each player starts with a supply of 16 carts, two transportation cards in hand, and one or two trade contract tickets that show locations in the Amsterdam market. On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up wild card, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route); or you draw two trade contract tickets and keep at least one of them.Whenever you complete a route that has carts depicted on it, with these primarily being on the perimeter of the city, you claim a merchandise bonus card.Players take turns until someone has no more than two carts in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for the routes that they've claimed during the game, the trade contract tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their carts), and their standing among those who hold merchandise bonus cards.

Electricity spread throughout the city, creating todays beautiful nocturnal Parisian streets and coining Pariss nickname La Cit de la Lumire, the city of lights.The most well-lit buildings are admired more highly by passers-by. In the first phase, players can either place tiles or grow their reserve of buildings. The cobblestone tiles are divided into 4 random spaces (their color, their opponents color, a streetlight or a mixed-color space where either player can build).Then, in the second phase, players build on top of their color or the mixed spaces, in effort to position their buildings as close to as many streetlights as possible.

Each player has her own scoresheet, which represents her zoo, with space for five types of animals: one crocodile, two ostriches, up to five lions. The scoresheet also has space to collect coins and barns for animals that don't fit in the appropriate pens.On a turn, the active player takes one of two actions:    Take two dice from the reserve, roll them, then assign each die to a transport cart on the game board.    Take all the dice in one transport cart, then tick off the animals/coins on those dice on your scoresheet.Dice can be placed in separate carts, and the number of dice is limited to six, eight, or ten depending on the number of players. The round continues until each player has taken dice from a cart, then a new round begins. The first player to fill the pen of a particular type of animal receives a bonus; if a player takes more animals than she has room for, however, she ticks off the barn for each type of overflow animal.The game ends once a player has filled all her animal pens or has space in only one pen. Players score one point for each animal and any bonus points they received; they lose two points for each barn ticked off, but for each group of coins collected, one penalty can be ignored.

From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host—you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.On their turn a player can take one of three actions:a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added.

Players draft cards through the mechanism used in the original Zooloretto; each turn a player adds a card to one of the piles or takes a pile. They score points for having the majority of animals in a species when a specific number of this species is in the zoos. The game includes six different species. Some of the animal cards have symbols triggering special actions when a player takes a second card of this species with the same symbol:    Heart: The player takes a baby animal of that species, if available.    Card: The player looks through the discard pile and takes a card of their choice.     Lightning bolt: The player must take a -1 point marker.If a player collects a symbol a third time, the special action is not carried out; instead the player discards the card and takes a -1 point marker.Some cards have food stalls, which give you money if you have the same symbol (pretzels, soft drinks, or ice cream) twice. This money can be used to steal an animal from the opponent or get rid of all -1 point markers. The first player to have all different types of stalls scores bonus points.The end of the game is triggered after the sixth in-game scoring or when the last round card is revealed.

Some figures have two random building plans at them, and if you visit one with the right resources, you can pay them, then build something. If you pay extra, you can then build something else, too!The first building is placed anywhere in the midst of play, then each subsequent building is placed adjacent to something already built, with the buildings eventually filling in a 4x5 (or 5x4, determined as the game progresses) grid of the players' own creation.

In the game, players choose combinations of special powers and races from the Warcraft universe, such as Portal Mage Pandarens or Herbalist Goblins, and vie for control of Azeroth. To help them achieve dominance, players will occupy legendary terrains and seek control of powerful artifacts. However, all empires must eventually fall, so players need to be ready to put an overextended race into a state of decline and lead a new one to rule Azeroth.In more detail, on each turn either you use the multiple tiles of your chosen fantasy race to (normally) occupy adjacent territories, possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race and let it go into decline. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side. At the start of the game or after you go into decline, you choose a new race/power combination at the start of your turn, with the 16 races and 20 powers being paired randomly each game.At the end of your turn, you score one coin for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depending on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy.

Lovecraft's weird fiction. The museum harbors artifacts that draw the attention of horrible beings, and the unfathomable wills of these creatures make themselves known in the form of blessings and curses. Four new Ancient Ones, eight new investigators, and several new monsters accompany the introduction of these powers, and the entrance of the museum has been remodeled thanks to four Entrance Cards, which give investigators more ways to spend their turn if they'd rather not attempt an adventure.Blessings and curses work their power in Unseen Forces through the introduction of a white and a black die. A blessed investigator gains the Blessed card and adds a white die to the player's dice pool, giving him an extra icon to use to complete his tasks. Being cursed forces a player to take the Cursed card and roll the black die along with the rest of his dice pool. If the player rolls any die that matches the result on the black die, he must discard both from his pool immediately.Blessings and curses don't keep building up on an investigator. Any blessed character who receives a second blessing can draw a spell card, a clue, or a common or a unique item card. Cursed investigators, on the other hand, are walking a very fine line. If an investigator has the misfortune of a second curse being inflicted, he is immediately devoured!

Hot on the heels of their success in Operatsiya Bagration, Soviet forces struck deep towards the Baltic coast, rapidly severing communications between German Army Group North and what little was left of Army Group Center.
By early October 1944, the Soviets were in view of the Baltic Sea, near the port of Memel, definitively cutting off Army Group North from any retreat route through East Prussia.
Despite Guderian's plea for an evacuation by sea and subsequent redeployment in Central Europe where forces were desperately needed to help stabilize an increasingly dicey situation, Hitler stubbornly refused.
Instead, he ordered the 200,000+ German troops to entrench themselves, in the hope of using the Courland Pocket as a springboard for a future offensive.

In Trial by Trolley, one player acts as the Trolley Operator and must choose where to send a murderous, out of control, trolley. Every other player at the table plays cards and argues in order to convince the operator to spare their lives and condemn everyone on the other track to a gruesome death-by-trolley.
Each round, one player will act as the trolley conductor. This person will be the judge, and will choose which track the trolley will murder.
Each other player is divided evenly among teams, and each player(s) will have a role for the round.
To begin, one player will draw 3 angelic tracks, choose one to play to the table, and then randomly reveal a 2nd angelic track from the deck to add to the track. Another player will draw 3 demonic tracks, and choose to add one to the opposing teams track, attempting to sabotage them, and spare their own tracks. Finally, player(s) will draw track modifiers to place on any track card on the table. They can play on their own tracks, to sway the judge, or they may play on their opponents, to further sway the judge into murdering their opponent's track.
The judge will ponder this conundrum, and eventually decide to murder one track. The track that was spared is the winner for the round!
Play continues for a number of rounds pre-determined by the number of players at the table.
Trial by Trolley is a game for 3-13 players, and plays in about 30-90 minutes.

Qwixx: Bonus consists of two new scorepads that provide twists on the normal way of playing Qwixx.
On one of the scorepads, the score sheet now includes twelve boxed spaces, with three boxes in each of the colored rows. Additionally, a row of twelve colored boxes lies below the colored rows. Whenever you cross off a boxed space, you cross off the next colored box in the row (e.g., a red box), then cross off the leftmost space of that color that you can legally mark off. This might cause a chain reaction, and it might cause you to complete a second row, which would then end the game.
On the other scorepad, ten spaces among the colored rows are marked with bonus boxes, with two each of five bonuses. When you mark off the second box of a particular bonus, you receive a special reward, such as crossing off the next two spaces of your row with the fewest marks, crossing off the next space of each active color, or doubling the score of your least valuable row at the end of the game.

Welcome to Mysterium Park!Its cotton candies, its circus, its dark secrets...
The park’s former director has disappeared, but the investigation came to nothing. Since that night, weird things are happening on the fairground. As psychics, you’re convinced that a ghost haunts this carnival... You’re now intent on giving it a chance to reveal the truth.
In this cooperative stand-alone game, the ghost sends visions with illustrated cards. The psychics try to interpret them in order to rule out certain suspects and locations. Then, they’ll seize their only chance to piece together what happened to the director. You have only six nights before the carnival leaves town... Open your minds and find the truth!
Set in the lights of a 1950's US fairground, Mysterium Park shares the same core mechanism with the famous award-winning game it reimplements, though bringing a different approach: it is smaller and faster, thanks to very quick setup and simplified rules.
Mysterium is a milestone in immersive and eye-catching experiences close to role-playing; with Mysterium Park, you can enjoy the heart of it in a more condensed way.

Sometimes the sea brings additional feathers, while the wind in combination with a campfire could burn a feather.Decorate the masks on the island, mask yourself, and press your luck!description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 25 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Betting and Bluffing, Deduction, Push Your Luck, Take ThatMakersOntwerper: Lars Jansen]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/15755-samoa.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/34268-home_default/samoa.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/15755-samoa.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8719214429508","999-SMO01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#196.000000}"

At the Conclave, the supreme overseer of all magic will be appointed. The power and honor of the great lords’ houses is at stake if they do not achieve enough influence over the different Magic types through alliances with the three Brotherhoods. Fellow mages, sharpen your tongues as the Conclave is about to commence!Play in tabletopia https://tabletopia.com/games/conclave-2020During the game you will send Emissaries to the Conclave to gain control of at least one Magic at the end of the game. To do so, you will have to attract followers to your Influence Zone. But beware: at the end of the game the followers that belong to a Magic you do not control will be disappointed, and will work to your disadvantage. In Conclave, the player with the least Resentment Points at the end of the game is the winner.The Main mechanism of the game is send a card (an emissary) from your hand to an empty space of the Conclave. Then the player will get followers if the sum of the influence of the cards in the  row of the emissary is 10 or more , the Mages with the same color or the same Brotherhood of the emissary will abandon the Conclave to join the area of followers of the player . The check to get followers also is done in the column where the emissary was placed. The emisary will remain in the conclave as a Mage.—description from the designer.Best Card Game by Carta Mundi - Premio Archimede 2018Winner Ciudad de Granollers Contest 2018 ..Los Emisarios de los grandes señores del reino se dirigen a la reunión de hechiceros más importante de todos los tiempos. En el Cónclave se decidirá quien tendrá el control de las magias durante los años venideros. Los grandes señores se juegan su poder y el honor de sus casas si no consiguen la suficiente influencia sobre las Magias a través de alianzas entre las tres Hermandades. ¡Hermanos Hechiceros, afilad vuestras lenguas que el Cónclave está a punto de comenzar!Durante la partida, enviarás Emisarios al Cónclave para obtener el control de al menos una Magia al final de la partida. Para lograr el control, atraerás seguidores de cada Magia a tu Zona de influencia. Pero cuidado, al final de la partida, los seguidores que pertenezcan a una Magia que no controles se sentirán decepcionados y jugarán en tu contra. En Cónclave, gana el jugador que acumule menos puntos de decepción.La Mecánica Principal del juego consiste en enviar una carta (un emisario) de tu mano a un espacio vacío del Cónclave. Entonces el jugador obtendrá seguidores si la suma de la influencia de las cartas en la fila del emisario es 10 o más, tanto los Magos con el mismo color como de la misma Hermandad del emisario abandonarán el Cónclave para unirse al área de seguidores del jugador . La comprobación para conseguir seguidores también se realiza en la columna donde se colocó el emisario.

Sometimes you need a fur, sometimes a tent, but these are all minor quests compared to your long-term goal: Painting a woolly mammoth on the wall so that humans thousands of years later will know that you once existed. (Okay, you just think the mammoth painting looks cool. Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)What might keep you from painting that mammoth? Death, in all its many forms.Each player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location — possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location — and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won't know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can help someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...At the day's end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.Paleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Exploration, PrehistoricMechanisme: Action/Event, Cooperative Game, Memory, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: Peter Rustemeyer]]>","boardgames","42.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/15835-paleo.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/34351-home_default/paleo.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/15835-paleo.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","42.95","8719214429430","999-PAL01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1646.000000}"

"5bb2c664-636e-45fe-9f43-ef15d3c05cba","<![CDATA[Skull (EN)]]","<![CDATA[Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:
Skull  Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card – until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull  Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.
Skull  Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull  Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull  Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull  Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.

Sometimes you need a fur, sometimes a tent, but these are all minor quests compared to your long-term goal: Painting a woolly mammoth on the wall so that humans thousands of years later will know that you once existed. (Okay, you just think the mammoth painting looks cool. Preserving a record of your past existence is gravy.)What might keep you from painting that mammoth? Death, in all its many forms.Each player starts the game with a couple of humans, who each have a skill and a number of life points. On a turn, each player chooses to go to one location  possibly of the same type as other players, although not the same location  and while you have some idea of what you might find there, you won't know for sure until you arrive, at which point you might acquire food or resources, or find what you need to craft a useful object, or discover that you can help someone else in their project, or suffer a snakebite that brings you close to death. Life is full of both wonders and terrors...At the day's end, you need food for all the people in your party as well as various crafts or skills that allow you to complete quests. Failure to do so adds another skull on the tote board, and once you collect enough of those, you decide that living is for fools and give up the ghost, declaring that future humans can just admire someone else, for all you care.Paleo includes multiple modules that allow for a variety of people, locations, quests, and much more during your time in 10,000 BCE.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Exploration, PrehistoricMechanisme: Action/Event, Cooperative Game, Memory, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Simultaneous Action Selection, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: Peter Rustemeyer]]>","boardgames","72.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16438-paleo-engels.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/34983-home_default/paleo-engels.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16438-paleo-engels.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","72.95","841333113049","ZMGZH007","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1658.000000}"

Place the four artist pillars in their starting locations among these stone stacks.On a turn, you either pick stones or score stones. To pick, move an artist to a new location, then collect all stones adjacent to this artist that (1) bear the same pattern as that artist and (2) are not adjacent to another artist. Choose one of these stones to be first in a tower, then stack the other collected stones on top of this foundation one in clockwise order, then place this tower on an empty space on your player board.To score, choose to remove either (1) a color that appears on the top stones of at least two towers on your player board or (2) any number of top stones on your player board. In the latter case, you score 1 point for each removed stone. In the former case, you score points for each removed stone depending on the scoring condition for that space on your player board, which might be based on the height of that stone in a tower or the number of colors in that tower or the height of all towers on your board. Place all removed stones on the shared central mandala, building from the inside out and possibly scoring points depending on the spaces that you cover.If a player can neither pick nor score OR if a stone placed on the central mandala covers the game-ending space based on the number of players in the game, complete the round so that everyone has the same number of turns.

All players lose if a single player can no longer play or discard any cards legally following the instructions given below. The players may not, however, communicate.Play is taken in turns moving clockwise with the quietest player going first. On a players turn they must do one of the following: 1. Play a card or 2. Discard two cards. Then they must draw back up to a hand of five cards. Cards must be placed so that the grid ascends in numerical order from bottom left to top right. If the card is placed next to an existing card in the sequence then they must discard cards from their hand equal to the difference between the numbers face down in front of them e.g. placing a 5 next to a 3 will require two cards to be discarded from their hand.

Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island's secrets.Lost Ruins of Arnak combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?Decks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.Discover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Ancient, Exploration, TravelMechanisme: Contracts, Deck, Bag, and Pool Building, Market, Multi-Use Cards, Once-Per-Game Abilities, Resource to Move, Solo / Solitaire Game, Turn Order: Progressive, Worker PlacementMakersOntwerper: Elwen, Mín]]>","boardgames","54.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16537-de-verdwenen-ruines-van-arnak.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35080-home_default/de-verdwenen-ruines-van-arnak.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16537-de-verdwenen-ruines-van-arnak.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","54.95","8718026304522","WGG2152","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2434.000000}"

The six-sided dice feature blue, red, yellow, and green symbols on four faces, along with a wizard on a fifth face and a jester on the sixth.At the start of the round, the seer places a circle on their bid for the round on his score sheet, a bid that specifies a color and a number from 1-5, e.g., blue-4. In turn, each other player places a bid that differs from all other bids placed this round. The seer then decides what color wizards will count as for this round.The seer then rolls the seven dice up to three times, keeping as many dice as they like after the first and second rolls. If a non-seer's bid is met after the first or second roll, then that player places an X through their bid. If the seer has rolled three times or made their bid, all players stop. If at this point anyone has made their bid, they X the circle; otherwise they write the difference between their bid and the number of that color rolled on the dice in the circle. Instead of writing this difference, a player can cross off the number of jesters showing on the dice in the jester row, assuming the number is from 1-5 and the player has not Xed this space previously.Whoever bid the highest amount in a different color than the seer becomes the seer for the next round. The game lasts multiple rounds, ending once one or more players has nine Xs in their bidding area. Players then score points, earning 1-5 points for each successful bid and losing points for the differences they recorded. Whoever scores the most points wins!Wizard Wrfelspiel includes ten spell cards that you can optionally add to the game.

"e98bb69d-da15-42c2-b087-bc6781233b92","<![CDATA[Royal Visit]]","<![CDATA[An unusual, complex, yet tightly balanced board/card game for two from the prolific Reiner Knizia.  The original title, Auf der Reeperbahn..., alludes to a popular German movie from 1954.Near the center of a 17-space track start the six game figures which the players compete to attract to their opposite ends of the board.  You play as many cards of the same color on your turn as you wish, and much of the movement is a direct result of card play:  e.g., by playing a red 4 you bring the red figure (Rote Lola or Dancing Deb) 4 spaces closer to your end of the board.However, there are special tricks and restrictions which must be learned and held firmly in mind before the sense of the game begins to emerge.  The central green figure (Brilli-Lilli or Saucy Sue) which wins for you if the game ends with her on your half of the board, for example, can only move within the bounds of her bodyguards, two grey figures.  The yellow figure (Blonde Hans or Handsome Hal) can summon, without benefit of a card played, any of these three figures to his square.  The companion green figure (Schampus-Charly or Champagne Charlie) which can also win the game if you get him into one of the two spaces at your end of the board (your nightclub), only moves toward you if the board situation at the end of your turn involves both bodyguards on your half of the board and/or one (or more) of the other figures in your nightclub.  And so on.The game, part of the Kosmos two-player series, is one of attack and counterattack, defense and forward thinking, and can be won early or on the turn of the last card on the second time through the deck.  At 10-20 minutes, it begs to be played again immediately.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Medieval, Movies / TV / Radio themeMechanisme: Hand Management, Track Movement, Tug of WarMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","21.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16786-royal-visit.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35340-home_default/royal-visit.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16786-royal-visit.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","21.95","3760175517273","IEL51727","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#380.000000}"

The residents of the cities however, took the bonfires for granted and exploited them for their personal gain. Disappointed the guardians of light retreated and let the bonfires extinguish. The citizens could no longer live in the now dark cities and were forced to leave.You are a group of gnomes living close to the cities and you also need and the light of the bonfires. Missing it now, you try yourself to visit the cities and learn how to ignite the bonfires once again: You must visit the guardians of light on their holy islands and ask for tasks to prove your good will. For each completed task, they will re-ignite one extinguished bonfire. Whoever manages to earn the greatest trust from the guardians and manages to brighten their city the most will win the game.The engine for Bonfire are the three-coloured tiles you will be puzzling onto your player board. When you manage to place the same colours adjacent to one another, you will receive more action tiles of that specific kind. This will allow you to specialize in certain types of actions and pursue different strategies. You can use the tiles to perform the following actions: - Move your ship to an island - Receive a task from an island by spending two resources - Invite a guardian of light into your city - Trigger a procession of guardians through your city and gain resources. - Add a landscape tile to your city (this is where the processions take place) - Recruit a gnome gaining a special ability or victory points - Find support by the last bonfire, gaining portals, resources or action tilesYou will play in turn order until a fixed number of tasks has been solved, after which each player has 5 more turns. During final scoring, you will receive points for your completed tasks (the bonfires) and any improvements made there (portals, landscapes or guardians).description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 70 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Fantasy, PuzzleMechanisme: Market, Pattern Building, Point to Point Movement, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire Game, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Stefan Feld]]>","boardgames","48.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16792-bonfire-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35346-home_default/bonfire-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/16792-bonfire-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","48.95","8720289470210","999-BNF01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2032.000000}"

Search for the right pieces to complete torn parchments, broken pots, and other priceless artifacts. Explore an ancient pyramid in the hope of uncovering a huge stash of treasure! Trade shrewdly at the local marketplace to increase the value of your collection. Sell your treasures to the museum at just the right time for maximum profit.But beware, the desert also has its dangers! A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!In Archaeology: The New Expedition, you want to find treasures and make the most money possible by selling them to the museum. Players start with four treasure cards in hand; one monument tile is chosen at random, then the chambers of the monument are loaded secretly with treasure cards.On a turn, a player digs for treasure by drawing from the deck. If they find treasure, they don't show anyone and keep it; if they find a thief, they steal a card at random from an opponent; and if they find a sandstorm, all players lose half of their cards in hand to the marketplace, which starts the game with five face-up cards. (Each player has a tent that they can discard to avoid the effects of one sandstorm.) After digging, a player can:     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order. Once the deck is empty, players keep taking actions until they all pass in turn, after which they sell treasures to the museum. Whoever ends up with the most money wins!According to the designer, Archaeology: The New Expedition differs from Archaeology: The Card Game through the inclusion of tent cards, the addition of new treasure types and additional cards to allow for five players, the adjustment of some treasure values, and the inclusion of six monuments instead of one to have more variety when exploring.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Open Drafting, Push Your Luck, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Phil Walker-Harding]]>","boardgames","24.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17120-archaeology-the-new-expedition.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35759-home_default/archaeology-the-new-expedition.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17120-archaeology-the-new-expedition.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","24.95","681706412801","[ib]ZMG41280","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#320.000000}"

If a newly played card is the direct successor of the card last played of that color, then you orient the card to show its dark side and suffer the penalty from that card, with the green penalty, for example, forcing the next card played to be green while the blue penalty requires you to give another player one of the face-up cards available from the Oracle.If a newly played card is not the direct successor of the card last played of that color, then you place the card with the light side face up, taking the bonus depicted on that half of the card if you desire, such as ignoring the next penalty or placing a card from your hand face up in front of you so that anyone could play it.Five shrines are play  one multicolor shrine and one of each color  and before or after your card play for the turn, you can choose to flip a shrine face down to use the bonus of that color.If you can't play or have no cards in hand, you must pass, and if all players pass in turn, then the game ends. Your score is based on the number of cards in all players' hands, with 0 being the best score possible. If you find the game difficult, you can include the tavern card that a few times each game allows a player to give limited information about their hand; if the game is too easy, you can remove some or all of the shrines to eliminate those extra bonuses.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: FantasyMechanisme: Communication Limits, Cooperative Game, Hand ManagementMakersOntwerper: César Gómez Bernardino]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17136-silencio.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35775-home_default/silencio.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17136-silencio.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8720289470159","999-SIL01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#128.000000}"

Would you be able to decipher an encrypted message found on the crime scene? Can you trace the suspect by navigating a map? It wont be easy, but if you get stuck, you can ask your colleague Charlotte for help. She runs the Puzzles and Riddles column in your newspaper, so she can always give you a hint about the mystery youre struggling with.Part of Chronicles of Crime - The Millennium SeriesChronicles of Crime is back with a range of games called The Millennium Series. Three brand new standalone Chronicles of Crime games, working with the same great system but providing interesting gameplay twists and refreshing universes that span an entire millennium from 1400 to 1900 and finally 2400. All three games are standalone but will offer connecting narrative threads for players to discover.-description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Deduction, Murder/Mystery, PuzzleMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Storytelling, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: David Cicurel, Wojciech Grajkowski]]>","boardgames","27.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17162-chronicles-of-crime-1900.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35843-home_default/chronicles-of-crime-1900.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17162-chronicles-of-crime-1900.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","27.95","8720289470555","999-CHR04","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#500.000000}"

Villages were torn apart, Riftforce emerged from it and spread across the land. What seemed lifeless before started to rise and wake. Flames left campfires and waves poured out of their riverbeds. Even the sun and moon leave their footprints in the ground.We learned how to control those living elementals and formed guilds to perfect this knowledge. While competing for Riftforce the guilds forged temporary alliances to share their unique abilities and guard the access to the Rifts.Now it is your time! Choose your guilds, combine their powers and rush into battle. Gain Riftforce from the land you control and all the elementals you destroy until you have enough to ascend into a higher state of power.In Riftforce, the two-player duel card game, each player starts by drafting four of the ten different guilds, each with a unique power, to forge their own asymmetrical alliance. Every game of Riftforce gives you a chance to discover new synergies between guilds which will greatly influence your overall strategy and strengths. Can you combine the flexible and mobile water guild with the all-consuming fire elementals who even harm their allies and unleash their full potential?The guilds elementals are the lifeblood of the game - they are your troops and at the same time the resource necessary to attack. Soon you will find yourself wondering how to use them best. Each turn you are torn, choosing one of three possible actions. Do you want to strengthen your position at the Rift, sacrifice elementals for powerful combo attacks or gather support for your next turn?Gain Riftforce by destroying the elements of your opponent and by controlling locations along the Rift. Only then will you ascend and win the game.Discovering new synergies between the different guilds, clever gameplay combos and the deeper layers of strategy will keep you coming back to enjoy the game again and again.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Fantasy, FightingMechanisme: Hand Management, Open Drafting, Race, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Carlo Bortolini]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17168-riftforce.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/35851-home_default/riftforce.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17168-riftforce.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","19.95","8718026304782","WGG2166","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#418.000000}"

Agent Kallus is one of the ISB's most effective agents, using his cunning and combat prowess to snuff out the spark of rebellion at its source.This expansion invites you to put this ruthless agent in command of your Imperial army, beginning with a highly customizable, unpainted hard plastic Agent Kallus miniature that reflects his status as a ruthless Imperial agent. In addition to choosing between two facial expressions for your miniature, you'll also be able to assemble your Agent Kallus with the trademark Imperial Security Bureau helmet or with no helmet at all. Finally, Agent Kallus is deadly up close and with a blaster and you can choose whether he appears with his signature J-19 Bo-Rifle in its blaster or staff forms.While these features project Kallus' status as a relentless ISB agent, his unit card clearly outlines all of his abilities and his three signature command cards reflect his capacity to shape your strategy. Despite all of his skills, Kallus is still susceptible to sympathizing with his enemies, a weakness that is reflected in Flaw card included with this expansion. Finally, Agent Kallus carefully calculates what he'll need for each battle and seven upgrade cards invite you to choose the gear and training that best fits your battle plan.description from the publisher]]>","boardgames","17.5","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17358-star-wars-legion-agent-kallus-commander-expansion.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/36096-home_default/star-wars-legion-agent-kallus-commander-expansion.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17358-star-wars-legion-agent-kallus-commander-expansion.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","17.5","841333112301","FFSWL80","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#98.000000}"

Each other player then selects the card in their hand that best matches the sentence and gives the selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to anyone else.The storyteller shuffles their card with all of the received cards, then reveals all of these cards. Each player other than the storyteller then secretly guesses which card belongs to the storyteller. If nobody or everybody guesses the correct card, the storyteller scores 0 points, and each other player scores 2 points. Otherwise, the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3 points. Additionally, the non-storyteller players score 1 point for every vote received by their card.The game ends when the deck is empty or if a player has scored at least 30 points.

Each time a player builds (crosses off) a building, it is marked on the separate scoring sheet so that all players can see how many of each building have been built. Then, each player rolls the dice one more time and places their blue and yellow dice on their player sheet on the appropriate numbers.Then, the start player rolls another set of dice. They may either choose one building which has not been built already and cross it out (and indicate it on the scoring sheet), or they may take one coin for each intersection which has already been crossed out (up to four coins).The two dice that are not used are passed to the next player (the numbers are kept the same), and the two used dice are re-rolled and put back on the player sheet with the new numbers.Coins can be used to re-roll dice (1 coin) or to mark out both buildings (3 coins). At the end of the game, 1st through 3rd place for each building type is awarded points, as well as bonus points for completed rows and columns.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: DiceMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Paper-and-PencilMakersOntwerper: Dirk Henn]]>","boardgames","24.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17412-alhambra-roll-write.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/36151-home_default/alhambra-roll-write.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17412-alhambra-roll-write.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","24.95","4010350105320","795532","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#520.000000}"

Poor Coyote had lost everything.They sat down by a fire to dry off and rest. Coyote became jealous of the other animals because they still had all their things, so he challenged them to a bluffing game to win their belongings. The other animals agreed to the challenge as they thought Coyote would never win. After all, he is known to never tell the truth  but in this game everybody has to lie because no one knows the truth...In the bluffing game Coyote, you always see the cards of the other players, but never your own. When it's your turn, you must announce a number that is less than the total of all the cards in the game, yet higher than the previous number given. Alternatively, you can challenge the number previously announced. Finally, when all the cards are revealed, you'll see who has the cunning Coyote on their side.Coyote is in the same game line as Spicy, with the game box and card backs being decorated with a special metallic print in copper. As in the tradition of the Northwest Coast Tribes, copper is a symbol of prosperity and cultural wealth.The artist Zona Evon Shroyer (Yupik Alaskan Native) is a master of the traditional Northwest Coastal art, whose richness of detail and complexity requires years of study and practice. For the cover illustration of Coyote, she designed a modern silhouette for the coyote, which she then filled in a classical manner with other animal motifs: turtle, beaver, and bear  the animals that he is sitting around the fire with and playing a game, in our little story.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: American West, Bluffing, Card Game, Humor, Math, Party GameMechanisme: Betting and Bluffing, Player EliminationMakersOntwerper: Spartaco Albertarelli]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17455-coyote.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/36198-home_default/coyote.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/17455-coyote.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8720289470340","999-COY01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#106.000000}"

A monstrous oni stomps toward the Emerald Empire, leading waves upon waves of deadly foes to breach the Great Carpenter Wall. It is the greatest threat that Rokugan has faced in centuries—and even if the clans can unite, there is no guarantee that they will survive.The Under Fu Leng's Shadow Premium Expansion is stuffed with 271 new cards for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game, and at the same time, it introduces two brand-new ways to play the game! Almost half of the new cards contained in this expansion are fully dedicated to the brand-new Shadowlands faction, and you can battle against the awe-inspiring might of the Shadowlands using two new game variants. You might choose to play the cooperative variant, either playing solo or teaming up with your friends to take on a mighty Shadowlands warlord. Or, you could embrace the darkness in a challenge variant, allowing one player to lead the forces of the Shadowlands into battle against two to four other players.Whether you battle the rising darkness together with your friends, challenge them to fight the Shadowlands hordes under your command, or use this expansion’s clan cards in your stronghold or skirmish games, Under Fu Leng’s Shadow is packed to bursting with exciting new content for every Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game player.]]>","boardgames","39.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18008-legend-of-the-five-rings-the-card-game-under-fu-leng-s-shadow.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/37619-home_default/legend-of-the-five-rings-the-card-game-under-fu-leng-s-shadow.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18008-legend-of-the-five-rings-the-card-game-under-fu-leng-s-shadow.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","39.95","","[ib]FFL5C42","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#712.000000}"

Its unsuspecting passengers fully anticipated a calm journey to Boston, Massachusetts, with nothing out of the ordinary to look forward to. However, strange nightmares plague the minds of the people aboard the ship every night; rumors circulate of dark shapes following closely behind the ship just beneath the waves; and tensions rise when a body is discovered in the ship's chapel, signs of a strange ritual littered around the corpse.Lurking within the depths of the Atlantic Ocean are a swarm of vicious, unspeakable horrors: the Deep Ones, led by Mother Hydra and Father Dagon. For reasons unknown, they have set their sights on the Atlantica, and their minions, taking the form of human-Deep One hybrids, have infiltrated the steamship to help sink it from within. Each game of Unfathomable has one or more players assuming the role of one of these hybrids, and how well they can secretly sabotage the efforts of the other players might mean the difference between a successful voyage and a sunken ship.If you're a human, you need to fend off Deep Ones, prevent the Atlantica from taking too much damage, and carefully manage the ship's four crucial resources if you want any hope of making it to Boston, all while trying to figure out which of your fellow players are friends and which are foes.

"1a6b1a7e-0a65-4891-b623-1ed595380574","<![CDATA[Merlin: Morgana Expansion]]","<![CDATA[Morgana introduces two new resources: Gold and Mistletoe that are present in all three new modules. Gold is used to procure other resources like shields, flags, and building materials. It is also worth points at the end of the game.  Mistletoe may be spent to ignore one requirement on a mission card, making them easier to fulfill.Module 1: MorganaThe enchantress Morgana is interfering with the search for the heir to the throne! Players may use Morgana once per round to help their cause and make it harder for other players to accomplish their goals. This module significantly increases the amount of direct player interaction in the game.At the beginning of the game round one Morgana die per player is rolled. Once per round for their turn, a player may choose to use a Morgana die and place it according to the depicted pips onto a cauldron, activating various special abilities. Additionally, they may move the Morgana figure on the board between principalities,  which blocks the principality as long as she is present. Nobody can place any figure (knight or Merlin) on the principality making any resources there unobtainable until Morgana is moved again (knights no longer count this space while moving)!Additionally Morgana brings her poisoned apples, which can be used by players to manipulate any knight die and even move other players knights to do your action, really interfering with other player's plans!And one more thingusing a Morgana die and spending construction materials or gold to increase the number to 7 will award the player the drinking horn that is kept in front of the player (till another player takes it from them, like Excalibur or the Holy Grail). The drinking horn not only awards one victory point as well as a poisoned apple immediately, but also gives victory points at the end of each round to the player who currently holds it.Module 2: CaerleonCaerleon offers hopefuls to the crown a host of new options in approaching their quest. Caerleon is comprised of 6 districts that replace the principalities on the game board. Each district works differently and alter the game play of the base game in various ways:Textile district - Here players gain a flag of any color, but it is also the only place in the city where players now can gain flags. When placing the flag-bearer, players may choose two flags instead of one.Stone cutter district - Here players gain a construction material of any color, but it is also the only place in the city to get construction materials. When placing the builder, players may choose two materials instead of one.Armor district - Here players gain a shield of any color, but it is also the only place in the city to get shields. When placing the shield-bearer, players may choose two shields instead of one.Gold district - Here players earn two gold each time they place a henchmen.Merchant district - Here players can gain up to 4 resources, flags, shields, and construction material of their choosing.

New strategies and tactics wait to be discovered.Module 3: MarketThe market gives players the opportunity to acquire different goods by spending gold. To qualify for using the market, they must not have completed a mission on their turn. Each of the available goods costs one gold, and once taken by a player is not replaced until the good is used or a scoring has taken place. Players may use these goods when they see fit, but they have to return any market good at the end of a scoring (After the 2nd, 4th and 6th round).The market goods:Shields and Construction materials  work the same as other shields and construction materials.Apple / Mistletoe  There tokens may be used either as an apple or as a mistletoe.+ 1 Influence - When the player uses the Lady-in-waiting to place an influence, they make place the token under the influence, making it count as two influence.Extra die - The token functions as an extra die of a specific value, granting the player an extra turn when they want. The number cannot be altered in any way though.- description from publisher's Kickstarter campaign]]>","boardgames","33.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18069-merlin-morgana-expansion.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/37695-home_default/merlin-morgana-expansion.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18069-merlin-morgana-expansion.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","33.95","4010350203033","[ib]QUE-795303","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#978.000000}"

Each racer needs boldness, tactical skills, and some good luck if they want to be the winner at the end of the race.On a turn, the active player rolls up to six dice (one at a time) and advances their racer according to the results. But be careful! If you roll doubles, you must draw a crash card and anything can happendepending on the double you may get a boost or be slowed down, letting others catch up. However, you can gain bonus cards for repeated doubles that can make up for lost position, if used correctly.Using the unique abilities of the racers and collecting Boost markers, the players can manipulate the outcome of the race to their advantage. On top of all of this, players may have to fight for track position. Whenever two racers share the same space, a duel takes place to decide who will advance by one space and who will stay.Finally, crossing the finish line will shuffle the racers positions due to the effects of the goal cards.-description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Dice, RacingMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Push Your Luck, RaceMakersOntwerper: Sebastian Richter, Anika Richter]]>","boardgames","42.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18506-scrap-racer.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/38218-home_default/scrap-racer.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18506-scrap-racer.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","42.95","4010350106020","QUE-795602","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1868.000000}"

Take advantage of this by taking on all the most prestigious government duties! Share cards, choose the most high-profile jobs...then experience an auction phase as belligerent as it is clever!In For the King (and Me), you wish to become the most valuable minister by collecting the right cards while lowering the value of your opponents' objectives. The game plays the same as the designer's earlier game Biblios, while allowing for play with up to five people at once.The game lasts multiple rounds with players first collecting cards, then bidding for cards. During the collection phase, as the active player you draw cards one at a time, keeping one for yourself, placing one in an auction pile, and placing the others face up for the other players to draft. Once you take a card, you can't take another, so sometimes it's a tough call to decide when you want to take something. Once you've had multiple collection phases, the cards in the auction pile will be auctioned one by one.Some cards are worth points depending on their color, some are worth gold, and some allowing you to manipulate the value of the various colors. Once all the cards have been auctioned, players reveal their hands and tally their points to see who wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Auction/Bidding, Auction: Turn Order Until Pass, Closed Drafting, Commodity Speculation, Hand Management, Open Drafting, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Steve Finn]]>","boardgames","20.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18530-for-the-king-and-me.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/38243-home_default/for-the-king-and-me.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18530-for-the-king-and-me.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","20.95","3760175518317","IEL51831","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#616.000000}"

To give clues in a round, the victim has 30 seconds in which to draw and write in a 3x3 grid  but before handing over these clues, the criminal can erase part of these drawings.If the criminal is not identified by the end of the fourth round, they win the game; otherwise, the detectives and the victim win.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-8Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Murder/Mystery, Party GameMechanisme: Deduction, Line DrawingMakersOntwerper: Lee Ju-Hwa, Giung Kim]]>","boardgames","21.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18534-last-message.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/38247-home_default/last-message.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18534-last-message.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","21.95","3760175518294","IEL51829","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#644.000000}"

Congratulations, you’re about to buy your own house! However, buying a house requires money. And lots of it. In order to lay claim on the piece of real estate of your choosing, you’re going to participate in an auction. But the market for real estate is tricky. Before you know it, some sneaky bastard walks away with your money. Or, as you’re strapped for cash, would YOU rather be that sneaky bastard?
Sneaky Bastard is an auction game with a twist. Whoever gets hold of the most expensive houses wins the game. You’re not only placing bids on the real estate, but also on the bids themselves with the aid of Sneaky Bastard-cards, in order to gain more financial means. In this way, the game plays like an auction-within-an-auction.
Sneaky Bastard is a fast-paced game that revolves around strategy, tactics and interaction. By carefully considering when to play a Sneaky Bastard, you’ll be able to gather the financials means to place bids in the later rounds. You’ll need the best real estate in order to win Sneaky Bastard, but you’ll also use houses as an alternative for money cards during later auctions.

To win, you must gain the most points by cleverly supplying ships and by adding the best businesses to your island.Your turn in Juicy Fruits works like this: First, you slide one of your fruit collector tokens a number of unblocked spaces and collect that many fruits of the token's type: banana, orange, lime, pomegranate, or mangosteen. Then you may either fulfill the order of a ship on your shores or claim a business from a shared display and place it onto your island (or do nothing). Clever planning and timing is vital because until you supply the ships on your shores, they block valuable island space which could be used to collect more fruit  but if you concentrate too much on the ships, the most promising businesses may get snatched by your opponents. Also, the sooner businesses are claimed, the quicker the game might end.With each play, Juicy Fruits poses new puzzles of how to move your tokens efficiently and how to balance clearing your island with claiming businesses. The game also includes an additional juice factory mode and four modes of solo play.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Economic, FarmingMechanisme: Area Movement, Contracts, Grid Movement, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Christian Stöhr]]>","boardgames","37.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18738-juicy-fruit-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/38534-home_default/juicy-fruit-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18738-juicy-fruit-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","37.95","8720289471149","999-JCF01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1586.000000}"

Each case includes a number of cards that ask you to find something on the map or uncover where someone has gone or otherwise reveal information relevant to a case. The city map serves as a map in time as well as space, so you'll typically find people in multiple locations throughout the streets and buildings, and you need to piece together what happened, whether by going through the case card by card or by reading only the starting card in the case and trying to figure out everything that happened for yourself. Will you be able to answer all questions about the case without fail?Unlike the original MicroMacro: Crime City, Full House marks each case with symbols so that parents can decide which cases the youngest investigators are cleared to research.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Deduction, Murder/MysteryMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Deduction, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Solo / Solitaire Game, Storytelling, Team-Based GameMakersOntwerper: Johannes Sich]]>","boardgames","28.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18739-micromacro-crime-city-full-house.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/38535-home_default/micromacro-crime-city-full-house.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/18739-micromacro-crime-city-full-house.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","28.95","8718026303532","WGG2169","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#484.000000}"

To set up, give everyone a ship that has room for twelve items (four under the deck out of view of others), then dump all of the equipment tiles in the center of the table. Take thirteen adventure cards in the appropriate number of the appropriate types (discovery, trade, pirates, contract), then lay them out in a circle around the equipment.When everyone is ready, reveal the adventure cards, then race to fill your ship with equipment tiles using only one hand, adding two colored goods in the special slots for those. Whoever finishes first scoops the cards up so that everyone else has to finish equipping their ship without seeing what's coming. You then shuffle the cards, then reveal them one by one:    Discovery: When this type of card is revealed, you can discard the 1 or 2 equipment tiles shown to receive the goods or money instead. Whenever you receive goods, they must be placed in an empty space on your ship; you can discard equipment to make room for them, if you wish.    Trade: You can trade the one good on the left of the card for the 2-3 goods on the right, if you wish.    Pirates: Before revealing this card, every player must say either fight or flee. If you flee, nothing happens to you. If you fight, you must be able to discard the equipment shown on the card or else you're penalized and must ditch some money and aa good; if you do have the equipment to drive the pirates away, you receive the reward shown on the card.    Contract: Place this on the bottom of the deck until only contract cards remain, then reveal them one by one. If you have the 1-4 goods showing on the card, you can discard them to get the monetary reward.At the end of the round, convert every remaining good into 1 coin, then for each ten coins, convert them into a treasure chest and place it on an empty space in your boat. Now you'll have less room on board for the second leg of this trip, which plays out nearly identically to the first one.In the end, whoever has the most money wins!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Pirates, Real-timeMechanisme: Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Carlo A.

Getting hold of the wrong letters leads to a broken heart. Getting the right letters ends the heartache and leads to victory. Who ends up winning the heart of Don Juan?Don Juan is based on the principle of I split, you choose. Per turn, the active player divides letters in different piles. Afterwards, each other player chooses a pile, with the remaining pile left over for the active player. The piles  consist of love letters in the colors of the players, but also of special letters such as the coveted gold letter or the dreaded bad letters. During the course of the game, getting hold of three love letters in your own color earns you a heart point. Whoever is first in collecting three heart points wins the game. However, bad letters penalize the players with broken heart tokens. By strategically mixing good and bad letters in piles, players are forced to deal with a dilemma every time they need to pick their pile.

If you increase your assets, you can build a building and use that building to acquire resources and victory points more quickly.The more buildings players construct, the more actions that become available on future turns. On a turn, players take one of two actions:     Production: Choose a resource card or building card in the production action area, and gain the item shown on it; or,     Trade: Discard resource cards from your hand to acquire resource or building cards of the same value or less from the available cards.In addition, players can use the effects of each building they own once per turn (including on the turn during which they were acquired). An example of a building effect is: exchanging a thread card in hand for cloth available in the play area. Chain together cards, buildings, and actions to create more victory points.

This player secretly chooses one card in his hand, then gives a word or sentence to describe this cardbut not too obviously. Each other player chooses a card in hand that matches this word/sentence and gives it to the storyteller. The storyteller then lays out the cards, and all other players vote on which card belongs to the storyteller. If no one or everyone guesses the storyteller's card, the storyteller receives no points and all players receive two; otherwise the storyteller and the correct guesser(s) each receive three points. Players score one point for each vote their image receives. Players refill their hands, and the next player becomes the storyteller. When the deck runs out, the player with the most points wins.Dixit Odyssey contains 84 new cards, each with a unique image drawn by Pier and colored by Marie Cardouat, artist of Dixit and Dixit 2. The stand alone version also includes a folding game board, 6 new rabbit scoring tokens (12 total), and a box large enough to hold all the Dixit cards released to date.

After you stop, all players can then use the results of the die roll to mark off empty spaces on one of their two cards  but if you want to use a color rolled on the dice, then you must use all of that color. If the die roll shows three purple, for example, you must cross off exactly three purple spaces; if you can't cross off three, then you cross off zero!The turn that you complete three or more rows on a card, you score that card, earning points equal to the collective length of the filled rows. You can also earn bonus points for completing one or both rows with sun symbols. You then take a new card from the deck.The game ends the turn that a player completes their fourth card. Every player then scores for completed rows on their cards (but not sun symbols), then whoever has the most points wins.Another way to play All on 1 Card is to start by choosing three cards from the five you are dealt, shuffling the others back into the deck.

(Note that this set is solely for two players, but it can be combined with other sets, which all serve up to four players.) Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.Robin Hood vs. Bigfoot features the titular heroes. Robin Hood and his outlaws excel at ranged attacks and robbing from their opponents. Bigfoot and his pal, the Jackalope, crash through the forest for quick attacks before disappearing like a figment of the mind.Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhauser for ranged attacks and area effects.The game includes a double-sided board with two different battlefields, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Oliver Barrett and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 9+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Mythology, Novel-basedMechanisme: Action Points, Card Play Conflict Resolution, Hand Management, Line of Sight, Point to Point Movement, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Rob Daviau, Justin D.

Tales describe the land as an idyllic paradise filled with marvelous dragon-made wonders and surrounded by a flourishing wilderness. The only portal to that world is the Wonder Book, an ancient tome locked away in an abandoned tower. It sleeps, covered in dust, awaiting the one thing it desires most: you.Wonder Book is a pop-up game for 1-4 players in which each player takes the role of a teenage kid in a group of adventurous friends. This is a co-operative game in which you all win or lose as a team.The game is split into six consecutive scenarios (chapters), each composed of a specific deck of pre-sorted cards that contain the rules, the story, and the challenges you have to face. Each chapter has you explore a new part of the interactive 3D cardboard pop-up book and reveals more about the world in which your adventure is set.Starting with the first card of the chapter deck, the story unfolds until you reach a goal card. These cards show a goal that must be achieved to proceed and explain how the players' and enemies' turns take place. Each hero can perform three actions per turn, including moving and fighting, using their individual skills, collecting sparks of magic (used to perform special actions), and interacting with cards and pop-ups. Once all heroes have taken their turn, a Wyrm card determines how the enemies will respond by moving, attacking, spawning, or doing something unexpected.The basic mechanisms are easy to grasp, but the game keeps changing as each scenario offers different things to do. You will find yourself exploring, fighting bosses, solving riddles, playing little minigames, looking for clues...anything is possible during the story!description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Card Game, Exploration, Fantasy, Fighting, MiniaturesMechanisme: Action Points, Cooperative Game, Dice Rolling, Events, Finale Ending, Move Through Deck, Multiple Maps, Narrative Choice / Paragraph, Once-Per-Game Abilities, Re-rolling and Locking, Scenario / Mission / Campaign Game, Solo / Solitaire Game, Variable Player Powers, Victory Points as a ResourceMakersOntwerper: Martino Chiacchiera, Michele Piccolini]]>","boardgames","77.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/19478-wonderboek.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/39654-home_default/wonderboek.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/19478-wonderboek.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","77.95","8720289471620","999-WNB01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2112.000000}"

"4a1260c5-2de7-4d00-a50a-9fdc95eba205","<![CDATA[Jamaica (NL/FR)]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.Setting: Jamaica, 1675.After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former colleagues to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the good old days, Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five holds of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as captain, with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the day and which to the night. Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to day - and one on the right (night). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a combat die, but players may improve their chances by using gunpowder tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Nederlands, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Nautical, Pirates, RacingMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Roll / Spin and Move, Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Malcolm Braff, Bruno Cathala, Sébastien Pauchon]]>","boardgames","38.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/19589-jamaica-nl-fr.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/39794-home_default/jamaica-nl-fr.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/19589-jamaica-nl-fr.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Space Cowboys]]","38.95","3558380088189","SPC17-101","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1272.000000}"

"d6a4418d-0103-4f8d-877a-1d1c40d0ecf2","<![CDATA[De Zoektocht naar El Dorado: Helden & Demonen]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.The Quest for El Dorado: Heroes  Hexes includes three new double-sided terrain tiles that add a new element to the game: curses. When a player stops on a demon space, they must draw and reveal a curse token to see how they're affected. Maybe they have to discard certain cards before they can travel on a particular type of terrain, or perhaps other explorers will move while the cursed one is paralyzed, or maybe you'll be afflicted by a demon, specifically a demon card that's shuffled into your deck and does nothing but frustrate you or get transformed into a half-coin each time you see it.Why would you travel to a demonic location when bad things would happen to you? Moving to that space doesn't cost a card, so you might just be being cheap, but additionally some demon spaces have tunnels that allow you to move directly from one hex on a tile to another on that same tile.

When a player stops on a demon space, they must draw and reveal a curse token to see how they're affected. Maybe they have to discard certain cards before they can travel on a particular type of terrain, or perhaps other explorers will move while the cursed one is paralyzed, or maybe you'll be afflicted by a demon, specifically a demon card that's shuffled into your deck and does nothing but frustrate you or get transformed into a half-coin each time you see it.Why would you travel to a demonic location when bad things would happen to you? Moving to that space doesn't cost a card, so you might just be being cheap, but additionally some demon spaces have tunnels that allow you to move directly from one hex on a tile to another on that same tile.

Gameplay is nearly identical to 2012's Qwixx, but with eight-sided dice allowing for higher numbers to be rolled and lucky numbers that give additional chances to mark off spaces.Each player has a scoresheet with the numbers 2-16 in rows of red and yellow and the numbers 16-2 in rows of green and blue. To score points you want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked-off numbers in the same row.On a turn, the active player rolls six eight-sided dice: two white and one of each of the four colors listed above. Each player can choose to mark off the sum of the two white dice on one of their four rows; additionally, if the sum of the white dice matches one of the two lucky numbers printed on your scoresheet, you immediately mark off the next number in the row in which you have the fewest marks.Then the active player can choose to mark off the sum of one colored die and one white die in the row that's the same color as the die. The more marks you can make in a row, the higher your score for that row. Fail to cross off a number when you're the active player, however, and you must mark one of four penalty boxes on your scoresheet. If you have at least six numbers marked in a row, then you can mark off either of the final two spaces in a colored row (15/16 in red/yellow and 3/2 in green/blue)  assuming the dice allow you to do so, of course. If you do this, you also mark off the padlock symbol in that row, locking everyone else out of this color.When either a player has four penalty boxes marked or a second color is locked, the game ends immediately.

Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.The aim of Paladins of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions.

After a brief stay in Lrien, your party is on its way back to Thranduil when they see smoke billowing up from the eaves of Mirkwood. The black plumes lead you to the smoldering remains of a Woodman village, with bodies strewn about and black-feathered arrows sticking from their backs. This is clearly the work of Goblins, and the pained gasps of a dying Woodman tells you that the survivors were taken by the fiends to their lair within the forest. You swear an oath to rescue them if you can, or avenge them if you cannot, and so you draw your weapons and follow the trail into the woods.This standalone scenario pack contains two adventures: The Oath and The Caves of Nibin-dm. These scenarios were originally released as part of the Limited Collectors Edition for The Lord of the Rings LCG.

Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other cards games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck  unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the fields in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete  and all trades on a turn must involve the active player  then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the beanometer for that particular type of bean. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.Bohnanza: 25 Jahre-Edition is a special 25th anniversary edition of the game that contains a new bean type (Elsterbohne; magpie bean) and comes with three variant games, one of which will use a collectible coin packaged in the box.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-7Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, FarmingMechanisme: Hand Management, Melding and Splaying, Negotiation, Set Collection, TradingMakersOntwerper: Uwe Rosenberg]]>","boardgames","19.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/20434-boonanza-25-jaar-jubileum-editie.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/40950-home_default/boonanza-25-jaar-jubileum-editie.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/20434-boonanza-25-jaar-jubileum-editie.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","19.95","8720289471446","999-BOO09","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#550.000000}"

All of the player cards for the cycle can be found in the Dunwich Legacy Investigator Expansion while all the encounter cards and campaign cards can be found in the Dunwich Legacy Campaign Expansion.—user summaryThe Dunwich Legacy is a deluxe expansion for Arkham Horror: The Card Game.Several months ago, three Miskatonic University professors armed themselves with secret knowledge, traveled to Dunwich, and brought an end to the strange and terrifying creature that had been terrorizing the secluded village. Their heroic efforts brought peace to the region—for a while—but also left the men scarred by the horrors they had witnessed. Now, one of those professors, Dr. Armitage, has need of your assistance. His colleagues have gone missing, and he fears the worst…The Dunwich Legacy challenges you to find the missing professors and launches you into a campaign that leads to Miskatonic University, the notorious Clover Club, and beyond. Five new investigators arrive to offer their services, armed with fifty-nine new player cards (including a complete playset of each) that allow you to pursue new deck-building strategies and new styles of play. Finally, you'll find all manner of new terrors arrayed against you—from backroom thugs and bad luck to arcane hexes and wholly unnatural abominations.—description from the publisher]]>","boardgames","46.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/20522-arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-dunwich-legacy-investigator-expansion.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/41107-home_default/arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-dunwich-legacy-investigator-expansion.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/20522-arkham-horror-the-card-game-the-dunwich-legacy-investigator-expansion.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","46.95","841333116002","FFAHC65","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#458.000000}"

This expansion also has victim cards that depict two types of beans. Shuffle the Bohn-edict cards with the regular Bohnanza cards, then deal everyone starting hands. Players then each take one victim card and place it at the back of their hand.Gameplay changes as follows: Bohn-edict cards serve as a joker and can be played onto either of your bean fields, but they have no beanometer, so if you must harvest a field with a Bohn-edict on top, you earn no gold! If a Bohn-edict is flipped during the trading phase, then the rule on the card comes into effect, changing the trading phase solely for that turn.If you have the two bean cards in hand  or in the hand and in trade  that match your victim card, you can discard the victim card and plant both of those beans in your graveyard. You can plant cards in the graveyard only if they match the top card on your graveyard, and when you harvest, you use the beanometer of the graveyard's top card and convert the most recently played cards into coins.The AMIGO version of Bohnedikt features more victim cards than in the Lookout Games version.]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/20977-boonanza-heilige-boontjes-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/41700-home_default/boonanza-heilige-boontjes-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/20977-boonanza-heilige-boontjes-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8720289472269","999-BOO11","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#134.000000}"

You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat.

Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available — unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife.

Finally, In Essos, Daenerys Targaryen has become the queen of Meereen, only to discover that the realities of rule differ greatly from expectations.The Dance of Shadows cycle reintroduces the player-favorite Shadow mechanism from A Game of Thrones: The Card Game First Edition. This mechanism increases the tension of your encounters, keeping games steeped in mystery and a constant fear of the unknown. As the sun sets on Westeros, you must decide how much of yourself you are willing to sacrifice in order for your plots to come to fruition.description from the publisher]]>","boardgames","9.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21208-a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game-second-edition-streets-of-king-s-landing.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/41940-home_default/a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game-second-edition-streets-of-king-s-landing.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21208-a-game-of-thrones-the-card-game-second-edition-streets-of-king-s-landing.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","9.95","841333105440","FFGT33","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#136.000000}"

Divide the loot from a bank robbery! But beware… Gang leader Blasting Billy is greedy and wants more loot than you. You only survive if you give the gang leader more than yourself. Other than that, it's every man for himself. Whoever takes the most points and survives Blasting Billy wins the game!
The Wild West in 1860…
As a member of Blasting Billy's savage outlaw gang, you've just completed the bank robbery of a lifetime. The loot is huge. But there is a problem. Gang boss Blasting Billy doesn't like to share! Anyone who claims more loot than Blasting Billy is out of luck.With Blasting Billy you have to deal cards smartly. The cards come in five suits. Each turn you can choose from three actions: lay the card in front of yourself, donate the card to Blasting Billy by placing it on the table with the correct color pile, or discard the card. At the end of the game it is checked how much Blasting Billy has gained in value per color. Anyone who has a higher card value in a certain suit is immediately out. Whoever stays alive with the highest value wins.Blasting Billy is a hilarious card game in which bluffing and clever math play a major role. If you can guess what your opponents are up to, you win the game. Do you know how to befriend Blasting Billy?

Each player occupies one of the four towers around the Witchstone and starts from there. Create your magic spells with the help of your cauldron, and put a network of magic energy around the stone. Send out your witches, scoop the magic crystals out of the cauldron, make use of the pentagram and the magic wand, and keep an eye on the prophecy scrolls in order to ensure victory.Not all options are always available to you. Only if you cleverly make the most of your opportunities will you have the chance of accumulating the most victory points over the eleven rounds and thereby win Witchstone.Each player in the game has a personal cauldron that bears seven crystals and six pre-printed magic icons, and they share a larger game board that features a crystal ball that shows the entire landscape. Each player has a set of fifteen domino tiles, with each half of the domino being a hexagon; each domino depicts two different magic icons from the six used in the game.On a turn, you place one of the five face-up dominos in your reserve onto your cauldron, then you take the action associated with each icon depicted on that domino; if the icon is adjacent to other dominos showing the same icon (or the matching pre-printed icon), then you can take that action as many times as the number of icons in that cluster. You must complete the first type of action completely before taking the second action. With these actions, you can:    Use energy to connect your starting tower to other locations on the game board, scoring 1, 3 or 6 points depending on the length of the connection.    Place witches next to your starting tower on the game board or move them across your energy network to other locations. As you do this, you gain points and possibly additional actions to use the same turn.    Move your token around a pentagram to collect points and to acquire bonus hex tiles; you can use these tiles immediately for actions or place them in your cauldron to make future tile placement more valuable.    Move the crystals in your cauldron, whether to make room for future tile placement or to gain bonus actions by ejecting the crystal completely.    Advance on a magic wand to gain points and take additional actions, with the actions being doubled should you currently be the most advanced player on the wand.    Claim scroll cards that boost future actions or earn you bonus points at game's end depending on how well you've completed the prophecy depicted.After each player has completed eleven turns  which could equal 40-60 actions depending on how well you've used your cauldron  the game ends and players tally their points from prophecies and other collected scoring markers to see who has the highest score.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: FantasyMechanisme: End Game Bonuses, Grid Coverage, Hexagon Grid, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Point to Point Movement, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Martino Chiacchiera, Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","50.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21537-witchstone-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/42306-home_default/witchstone-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21537-witchstone-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","50.95","8720289472207","999-WIT01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1801.000000}"

In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels  which contain clues, riddles and traps  and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose  sometimes really badly!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1Speelduur: 0 min.Leeftijd: 6+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Book, Comic Book / StripMechanisme: MakersOntwerper: Shuky]]>","boardgames","21.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21763-comic-game-knights.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/42519-home_default/comic-game-knights.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21763-comic-game-knights.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Blue Orange]]","21.95","9782917371831","00457","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#498.000000}"

You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round's start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.Alternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.Each player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.For each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!Additionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.When someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Industry / ManufacturingMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Closed Drafting, Pattern BuildingMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","44.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21779-mille-fiori-nl-pre-order-eind-juni.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/42557-home_default/mille-fiori-nl-pre-order-eind-juni.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21779-mille-fiori-nl-pre-order-eind-juni.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","44.95","8720289472443","999-MIL01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1252.000000}"

You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.When someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Industry / ManufacturingMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Closed Drafting, Pattern BuildingMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","44.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21779-mille-fiori-nl-pre-order-eind-juni.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/42559-home_default/mille-fiori-nl-pre-order-eind-juni.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/21779-mille-fiori-nl-pre-order-eind-juni.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","44.95","8720289472443","999-MIL01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1252.000000}"

Choosing peace over prosperity, our once strong King began offering our enemies gold and land to lay down their axes. But peace is a tenuous affair. As poverty spread, many people lost faith in his ability to lead and sought independence from the crown. Since finding favour in his courts, our future has also become uncertain. As viscounts, we must be wise and decisive. Loyalty is to be upheld, but gaining favour among the people must be our priority, should there be a sudden shift in power.The aim of Viscounts of the West Kingdom is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by constructing buildings, writing manuscripts, working in the castle and acquiring deeds for new land. Players begin with a handful of townsfolk, but should quickly seek out more suitable talents to advance their endeavours. Each turn they will be travelling around the kingdom, looking to increase their influence among the various areas of society.

Players guide the development of their tribes across several generationsfrom nomadic hunter-gatherers to prosperous tribal societies. Over the course of the game, tribes migrate and settle new lands, establish cultural traditions, hunt paleolithic megafauna, and build everlasting megalithic structures.Endless Winter is a euro-style game that combines worker placement and deck building in an innovative way. Each round, players send their tribe members to various action spaces, and pay for the actions by playing cards and spending resources. Tribe cards grant additional labor, while Culture cards provide a variety of unique effects. As an alternative, cards can be saved for an end-of-round Eclipse phase, where they are simultaneously revealed to determine the new player order, and trigger various bonus actions.The game features a novel blend of interwoven systems and mechanisms, such as multi-use cards, area influence, tile placement, and set collection. Plus, there are many viable paths to victory.

On most turns, you will form a boarding party by taking a stack of pirates in front of you (with a stack consisting of one or more tokens with you on top), moving them on top of a stack in front of another player, then moving the new stack back in front of you.On a future turn, you may use this stack to capture one of the four cards in the display as long as the size of the party meets the minimum requirements. The pirate on top of stack is the captain, and they receive a treasure for leading the raid. (The second pirate in the stack, the mate, might also receive a treasure.) They collect the gold listed on the card, then must pay the value listed on each pirate in their crew, making up any gold they lack from their own coffers. If they do this, they keep the card and increase their scoring.You can mutiny by placing a stack on another stack, then going after one of the four cards immediately, but you must then pay the mate and the rest of the crew double their pay.After all cards have been captured and the game ends, players receive additional gold based on the relative number of treasures they have captured.

On your turn, you can either take or sell cards. If you take cards, you have to choose between taking all the camels, taking one card from the market, or swapping 2-5 cards between the market and your cards.If you sell cards, you get to sell only one type of good, and you receive as many chips for that good as the number of cards you sold. The chips' values decrease as the game progresses, so you'd better hurry! On the other hand, you receive increasingly high rewards for selling three, four, or five cards of the same good at a time, so you'd better wait!You can't sell camels, but they're paramount for trading and they're also worth a little something at the end of the round, enough sometimes to secure the win, so you have to use them smartly.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Animals, Card Game, EconomicMechanisme: Hand Management, Hidden Victory Points, Market, Open Drafting, Score-and-Reset Game, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Sébastien Pauchon]]>","boardgames","21.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22125-jaipur-en.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/43037-home_default/jaipur-en.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22125-jaipur-en.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Space Cowboys]]","21.95","3558380063933","SPC16-001EN","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#350.000000}"

Their play area consists of the four spaces of their board, and the two nearest spaces on their left and right neighbors (for a total of 8 spaces). On a turn, they may draw a card, start a ceremony on personal player board, as long as there is not a ceremony of that type on in their play area; or play a card from their hand into any ceremony in their play area. Once started, a ceremony in your player grants a special ability until it is completed.Ceremonies are complete after the fourth card is played to it, with the player claiming a victory point tile, and putting out a game end token if none is available. When all of the game end tokens have been put out the game ends.

"8a378838-a544-44ef-9ba6-3a11785bab03","<![CDATA[The Game - nieuw artwork]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.Players in The Game try to discard all 98 cards in the deck onto four discard piles in order to win, but they need to do so in the right ways.Each player starts with 6-8 cards in their hand depending on the number of players, and four discard pile prompt cards are on the table: two showing 1 and an up arrow and two showing 100 and a down arrow. On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from their hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect of the game is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn. If you play all 98 cards, you win! If you get good, the rules suggest that you play at least three cards a turn to increase the challenge.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, NumberMechanisme: Communication Limits, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Steffen Benndorf]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22251-the-game-nieuw-artwork.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/43334-home_default/the-game-nieuw-artwork.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22251-the-game-nieuw-artwork.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026305369","WGG2237","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#214.000000}"

On a turn, you either draw two transportation cards from the deck or the display of five face-up cards (or you take one face-up ferry, which counts as all six colors in the game); or you claim a route on the board by discarding cards that match the color of the route being claimed (with any set of cards allowing you to claim a gray route, although some require ferries); or you draw two destination tickets and keep at least one of them.When you build a line that connects to a souvenir location, such as Lombard Street, the Embarcadero, or the Golden Gate Bridge, you take a souvenir token from that location.Players take turns until someone has no more than two cable cars in their supply, then each player takes one final turn, including the player who triggered the end of the game. Players then sum their points, scoring points for (1) the routes that they've claimed during the game, (2) the destination tickets that they've completed (by connecting the two locations on a ticket by a continuous line of their cable cars), and (3) the souvenirs that they've collected, with a full set of seven souvenirs being worth 12 points.

Drenched to the bone, you look up to see a brilliant beam of light pierce the curtains of rain. A lighthouse! But suddenly and inexplicably, the light goes out. You glance out into the water and spot a ship. It is heading straight for the cliffs! You realize that it is up to you to race to the top of the lighthouse and turn it on again before the ship crashes on the cliffs! But many puzzling obstacles stand in your way...In Exit: The Game + Puzzle – The Deserted Lighthouse, there are riddles within riddles, hidden within four 88-piece jigsaw puzzles. Like other Exit titles, The Deserted Lighthouse has no game board, but it also has no riddle cards. Instead, there are four jigsaw puzzles that you will find and assemble, one at a time. Each completed puzzle reveals a location containing more riddles to decipher.In EXIT The Game: The Deserted Lighthouse, you must work to solve the riddles and reach the lighthouse’s top to activate its beacon, saving the approaching ship before it smashes against the rocks and sinks to the bottom of the sea.At the start of the game, all you have available to you are the puzzle bag containing pieces with a grayish-blue back and no pattern, and the decoder disk. But there are also strange items to be found within the game that may be used to help solve the riddles found in each of the puzzles.The game ends when you have solved the last riddle and reactivated the lighthouse beacon to save the ship from sinking.Difficulty Level: 4 of 5.—description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 120 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Mechanisme: Cooperative GameMakersOntwerper: Inka Brand, Markus Brand]]>","boardgames","24.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22495-exit-de-eenzame-vuurtoren.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/43759-home_default/exit-de-eenzame-vuurtoren.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22495-exit-de-eenzame-vuurtoren.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","24.95","8720289472177","999-EXI20","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#544.000000}"

Using the numbers revealed by the cards, all players fill up their subway map with Xs in the station spaces. However, the number of times they can add stations to each line is limited, so they have to make tough choices. Players can score many points by getting their star bonuses in stations with many intersecting routes. Players also get bonuses by being the first to complete routes. Try to fill in all your stations to minimize the penalties and achieve a high score!In more detail, each player has their own sheet of paper, with the game including subway maps for Amsterdam, Berlin, Paris, and Madrid, with the first two being recommended for new players. Each sheet shows an interwoven subway system, with the system consisting of many subway lines; each line has a name, a number of indicator boxes, a number of empty station boxes on the subway route, and two bonuses. On a turn, a player reveals the top indicator card from the deck of fourteen cards, then each player individually and simultaneously chooses a subway line, then does something depending on which type of card is revealed:    If a number is revealed, the player writes the number in one of that line's indicator boxes, then draws a X in each box in the line starting with the closest empty box, stopping when they've reached the end of the line, reached an already filled-in space, or drawn the indicated number of Xs.    If a circled number is revealed, the player does what is described above, but they can skip over already filled-in spaces instead of stopping.    If a star is revealed, the player draws a star in one of that line's indicator boxes, then in the closest empty space on that line they write a number equal to double the number of lines that pass through that station box.    If a circle is revealed, the player writes nothing in an indicator box and draws a X in any empty station box.At the end of a turn, if a player has finished a subway line by reaching the final space, they announce this to all players, then score the larger of the two bonuses for this line; all other players cross out the large bonus and can score the small bonus for themselves if they complete this line later. Multiple players can score a line's bonus on the same turn. If the indicator card has a shuffle icon on it, shuffle all of the indicator cards together before the next turn.Once all the indicator boxes are filled, the game ends. Players tally their points scored for completing lines and for writing numbers in boxes, then lose points based on the number of empty spaces that remain on their sheet. Whoever has the highest score wins!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-6Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Number, Puzzle, TrainsMechanisme: Bingo, Network and Route Building, Paper-and-Pencil, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Hisashi Hayashi]]>","boardgames","15.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22503-metrolijn.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/43775-home_default/metrolijn.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22503-metrolijn.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","15.95","8720289473228","999-MTL01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#352.000000}"

Each hero is represented by a unique deck designed to evoke their style and legend. Tactical movement and no-luck combat resolution create a unique play experience that rewards expertise, but just when you've mastered one set, new heroes arrive to provide all new match-ups.Battle of Legends, Volume Two features four heroes: Yennenga, Achilles, Sun Wukong, and Bloody Mary.Combat is resolved quickly by comparing attack and defense cards. However, each card's unique effects and a simple but deep timing system lead to interesting decisions each time. The game also features an updated version of the line-of-sight system from Tannhuser for ranged attacks and area effects.The game includes a new battlefield with a brand new mechanism, pre-washed miniatures for each hero, and custom life trackers that's brought to life with the stunning artwork of Zoe van Dijk and the combined design teams of Restoration Games and Mondo Games.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 9+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Horror, Mythology, Novel-basedMechanisme: Action Points, Card Play Conflict Resolution, Hand Management, Line of Sight, Point to Point Movement, Team-Based Game, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Noah Cohen, Rob Daviau, Justin D.

Each turn, decide whether to continue with an expedition or start a new one. Acceleration fields and artifacts provide opportunities to advance quickly, but you'll have to carefully consider which paths to take on which roll. If you make good progress, victory beckons  but if an expedition gets stuck, you will lose points just as quickly as you earned them!In more detail, each player has their own score sheet, which has eight columns on it: six colored columns matching the colors of Lost Cities (red/orange/yellow/green/blue/purple), an artefact column, and a dice column. You will fill or mark all of these columns from the bottom up.On a turn as the active player, you roll the six dice  three six-sided color dice and three ten-sided dice numbered 0-9  then choose one number die and one color die, then mark this number in this color column on your sheet. If you choose 0 and haven't started this color column, you can mark the double point circle at the bottom of the column. If you choose a non-0 number and haven't started this column, you write the number in the bottommost space of the column; if you have started this column, then you can add another number to this column only if it's the same value or higher. (A 0 is written as 10 in a column.) Other players choose a number die and a color die from the two of each that remain, then mark one of their columns in a similar manner.If you place a number on an arrow in a column, then you can accelerate any color column by filling the bottommost empty space with the same number currently at the top of that column. If you write over another arrow, then you accelerate once again! If you place a number on an artefact box, then you mark off a space in the artefact column. If you've filled all nine spaces in a column and can write a number there once again, you instead mark off an artefact.If you wish, you can refuse to choose a number-color combination. If you do, then you mark off a die in the dice column.If you write a number in the seventh box in a color column or mark off the seventh space in the artefact or dice column  and you're the first player to do so  then you score a 20 point bridge bonus for being the first player to cross that bridge.If you mark off the ninth space in the dice column, you are considered to be exhausted, but you continue to play. The game ends after the turn in which all players are exhausted or all eight bridges have been crossed. Players then score points for each color column based on the number of spaces they've filled, doubling this score  whether positive or negative  if they've marked the double point circle at the bottom of the column. Players also score points for the number of spaces marked in the artefact and dice columns, but if you're exhausted, then you score 0 points for that column. Add your bridge bonus points to the sum of these eight columns, and whoever has the highest score wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: DiceMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Paper-and-PencilMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","15.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22758-lost-cities-roll-write.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/44123-home_default/lost-cities-roll-write.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22758-lost-cities-roll-write.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","15.95","8720289473921","999-LOS06","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#284.000000}"

After that, three scoring conditions, one economy card (showing how players earn money), and one twist card are dealt, giving the unique features of the game. Each player is dealt five ability cards and one terrain card.On your turn, you must place three houses in the terrain depicted on your terrain card. If possible, you must place the houses next to previously placed houses. (If not possible, they may be placed anywhere that matches the terrain on the card.) You also start the game with a limited number of forts, which can replace any house and which count as two pieces.After placing houses, you may use your gold to make one purchase, either paying the cost to put one ability card into play or paying an additional cost on a previously placed ability to upgrade it. Once purchased, the ability may be used once per turn for the rest of the game. You start the game with a little gold to buy abilities and can earn more gold based on the economy card in play for that game.The game ends once one player is out of both houses and forts. Players score based on the criteria of the scoring cards for that game; in addition, whoever has the most houses next to each castle scores 3 additional points. The player with the most points wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  Engels, DuitsSoort spelType/Thema: Mechanisme: Hexagon Grid, Modular Board, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: Donald X.

Be careful you don't end up in the shadow, and use the power of light to form complete RAINBOWS. Tactics, combination skills and a good memory are what it takes to win.The aim of the game is......to collect more cards than your opponent by playing your cards skilfully.On your turn, you can play up to 3 cards in the common area, but you have to play at least 1 card. But:- If you want to play more than 1 card, you must turn over any one of the cards already on the table. This means, cards are always turned over and played alternately. You cannot turn over or play two cards in a row.- You can choose to play your cards standard or blind. Standard means you place the card with the side you can see facing up. Blind means you place the card with the back (that you haven't seen) facing up.- Error! If you play or turn over a card in a colour that is already on display, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.- Shadow! If you play or turn over a card in black, you lose the round. Your opponent receives all the cards in the row.- Rainbow! If you succeed in playing the 6th card of the row in a colour still missing from the rainbow, you have successfully formed a RAINBOW. As a reward, you receive all 6 cards.The game ends immediately when there are not enough cards in the deck for a player to bring their hand back up to 3 cards. The player who has collected the most cards in their personal pile wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 10 min.Leeftijd: 7+Taal:  Nederlands, EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, MemoryMechanisme: Memory, Pattern Building, Push Your LuckMakersOntwerper: Mathias Spaan]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22851-rainbow.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/44255-home_default/rainbow.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/22851-rainbow.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8720289474300","999-RAI01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#140.000000}"

In more detail, the game board shows a map of a city with certain locations being connected by colored paths. Each player starts with four colored parade float cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two locations, and you're trying to connect those two locations with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.On a turn, you either draw two parade float cards from the deck or discard parade float cards to claim a route between two locations by placing your ghost trains on it; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two locations shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket. (If you can't connect locations on either ticket because the paths are blocked, you can take your entire turn to discard those tickets and draw two new ones.)If you create a route all the way from the Dark Forest region to the Seashore region, you collect the trick or treat bonus.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 6+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Children's Game, TrainsMechanisme: Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Set CollectionMakersOntwerper: Alan R.

In more detail, the game board shows a map of a city with certain locations being connected by colored paths. Each player starts with four colored parade float cards in hand and two tickets; each ticket shows two locations, and you're trying to connect those two locations with a contiguous path of your trains in order to complete the ticket.On a turn, you either draw two parade float cards from the deck or discard parade float cards to claim a route between two locations by placing your ghost trains on it; for this latter option, you must discard cards matching the color and number of spaces on that route (e.g., two yellow cards for a yellow route that's two spaces long). If you connect the two locations shown on a ticket with a path of your trains, reveal the ticket, place it face up in front of you, then draw a new ticket.

There, they hope to locate the Dwarf named Nalir, who holds information that the White Wizard believes may prove valuable in the fight against the Dark Lord of Mordor. Finding the Dwarf proves to be a matter of very little difficult, but gaining the information he can provide proves to be a greater challenge...In Trouble in Tharbad, the third Adventure Pack in ""The Ring-maker"" cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, your heroes must help Nalir extricate himself from the unfortunate predicament into which he has placed himself. You must battle Orcs, slip through abandoned streets, and seek to elude the spies from Mordor who have also taken an interest in the Dwarf and his information. Throughout the scenario's course of events, you must remain vigilant in order to keep Nalir alive. Should he perish, so will your chances of returning his information to Saruman, and the White Wizard's efforts to counter the threat of Mordor will be diminished.Along with its new scenario, Trouble in Tharbad introduces a new Silvan hero, along with three copies of each new player card.

Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 glory points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn pirate or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 180 min.Leeftijd: 13+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Fighting, Nautical, Pike and Shot, Pirates, TransportationMechanisme: Action Points, Area Movement, Bias, Dice Rolling, Events, Pick-up and Deliver, Race, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: Kasper Aagaard, Christian Marcussen]]>","boardgames","59.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/23511-merchants-marauders.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/45177-home_default/merchants-marauders.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/23511-merchants-marauders.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Z-Man Games]]","59.95","681706070629","ZMG7062","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2394.000000}"

The game is played over eight rounds. At the beginning of the round, six colored dice are rolled, with players receiving a threat marker in the color of any die that rolls a 5 or 6. The black die is a wild threat, with players drawing a threat token with one of the other threat types hidden on the back. If a player ever has three of one type of threat, they receive a penalty.Next, players have the opportunity to pay a number of coins (equal to the pips on all diceshowing a 1 or 2) to advance on the mayor's track. The black die also activates the clergy in St.Michael's Church, which serves as a round counter and awards points for certain building types at the end of the game.On their turn, players play five cards from any of five stacks of cards, one for each of the five colors in the game. These cards are in thirteen categories, each representing a different location around Hamburg, with seventeen individual cards within each category. Each card in a player's hand may be used for a number of purposes, including building the city wall, activating boats (if a 3 or 4 is rolled), starting a building plot, and constructing a building (card) on the plot, with this building granting a new ability or endgame scoring condition.Players receive points for various accomplishments during the game. In addition, they may receive bonus points by being the only player to have achieved one of five conditions for that round. Whoever scores the most points after eight rounds wins.Hamburg is a reimplementation of Bruges, including The City on the Zwin and Pets expansions and some new content, with some moderate rules enhancements.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, City Building, EconomicMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Stefan Feld]]>","boardgames","98.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/23991-hamburg.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/45828-home_default/hamburg.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/23991-hamburg.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","98.95","4010350260135","QG-26013","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#3168.000000}"

This would be easy  except that the person drawing the line is blindfolded and must receive direction from the other players. All other players form a line and have different means of communicating where to draw the line next. A complex chain of hampered communication forms in which information is lost or misinterpreted, making the simple task of drawing a line quite challenging.With four different tracks and many difficulty levels as well as a team vs. team variant, this party game does not become stale and can be played countless times!description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-14Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Action / Dexterity, Party GameMechanisme: Line Drawing, Race, Real-Time, Team-Based GameMakersOntwerper: Urtis Šulinskas]]>","boardgames","31.5","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/23994-way-2-go.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/45831-home_default/way-2-go.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/23994-way-2-go.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","31.5","4010350105122","QG-10512","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#938.000000}"

The players  task is to design pavilions across the square to protect pedestrians in the rain. Helsinki is based on the design of Copenhagen by the same design team, but with some added complexity.The center board depicts the Senate Square with 8 spaces (two per side) and 8 cards, with each card connected to two spaces. The player on their turn advances their pawn 1-3 spaces, then must choose to take cards or build a pavilion. Each space is connected to two face up cards, and the player may choose to draw these into their hand (making sure to respect the 7 card hand limit, a key challenge in the game). The cards are in one of 5 colors and show a shape of size 2 to 5. To build a pavilion, the player plays a card showing the piece they want to play, and then must play an additional number of cards of the same color to match the size of the piece. Finally, the piece must be slid onto their game board (which also represents the Senate Square) from the side of the Square their pawn is on on the main board. Covering certain spaces earns a coat of arms, which may be spent to use one of the 15 one-time special actions.Players score points for completing rows and columns, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.-description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: Mechanisme: Grid Coverage, Open DraftingMakersOntwerper: Asger Harding Granerud, Daniel Skjold Pedersen]]>","boardgames","85.5","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24042-helsinki-deluxe.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/46191-home_default/helsinki-deluxe.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24042-helsinki-deluxe.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","85.5","4010350107232","QG10723","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2148.000000}"

Bing: Game play reverses direction.    Bang: Game play continues in the same direction, but skips the next player.    Boom: Everyone must slap and leave their hand on the Boom while saying BOOM!.Penalties for playing out of order, slapping the deck when no Boom was played, being last to hit the Boom card, playing too slowly, etc. are distributed in the form of tokens, with players starting with one face-down token for each sound: Whizz, Bing, Bang, Boom (ordered low to high). The player who is first to hit the Boom card gives a token to the player who hit it last, but in all other penalty situations, players must race to find the lowest face-down token they hold and give it to the penalized player face up; whoever does so first gives the token away while all other players keep theirs and reshuffle them. When one player gives his Boom token away, each player scores one point for each token he holds. When a player has scored 15 or more points, the game ends and the player with the fewest points wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Action / Dexterity, Card Game, Party GameMechanisme: MakersOntwerper: Antoine Riot]]>","boardgames","9.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24068-whizz-bing-bang.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/45924-home_default/whizz-bing-bang.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24068-whizz-bing-bang.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","9.95","3760175510717","IELLO-51071","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#276.000000}"

On a turn, a player may choose to take two adjacent cards from the display (they may never hold more than 7 cards), or use cards to buy facade tiles in various shapes and colors. Any tile may be purchased, but you get a discount if you place a tile touching another one of the same color.

The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill. Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency. Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their ""native"" currency. With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.
In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.
The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market. The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies. On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.
Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external ""wall"" section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.
Integrates with:
Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)

Just when we thought we'd have to settle for Mars, we suddenly discovered a new planet, one we lovingly christened Planet B. It was a second chance for humanity, and of course we were determined to do everything right this time because as everyone knows, we humans learn very well from our mistakes...In Planet B, you slip into the role of corrupt governors. You make crooked deals with corporations to advance your own interests. You build your city, let the population work for you, rise in the favor of political factions, or control the news. Of course, all of this comes at a price  and by the time you're vying for the presidency, you'll want potential voters to be on your side. In the end, as always, only one thing counts: Who has managed to pocket the most government money?Irgendwann in einer nicht mehr so weit entfernten Zukunft, mussten wir Menschen uns ein neuen Lebensraum suchen. Gerade als wir dachten, uns mit dem Mars zufrieden geben zu mssen, entdeckten wir pltzlich einen neuen Planeten - wir tauften ihn liebevoll Planet B.Dort sollten wir also eine zweite Chance bekommen. Und natrlich hatten wir fest vor, diesmal alles richtig zu machen. Denn wie jeder wei, lernen wir Menschen sehr gut aus unseren Fehlern...In Planet B schlpft ihr in die Rolle korrupter Gouverneurinnen. Ihr schliet krumme Deals mit Konzernen ab, um eure eigenen Interessen durchzusetzen. Ihr baut eure Stadt auf und lasst die Bevlkerung fr euch arbeiten, steigt in der Gunst politischer Fraktionen auf oder kontrolliert die Nachrichten.Natrlich hat das alles seinen Preis - sptestens, wenn ihr um die Prsidentschaft wetteifert, wollt ihr eure potenziellen Whler auf eurer Seite wissen.

Players may choose to use the six dice going from right to left or left to right in order to build the power lines on their board. However, they may use a certain number of dice only a fixed number of times, and a die may be skipped only by taking a penalty.During certain rounds, each of the three game objectives will be evaluated, and at the end of the game players gain points for completed power lines and fully connected cities, then lose points for lines they started but did not complete.

With the enemy's minions closing in and innocents in peril, our heroes will need to work together to stop the villain's plans and save the world  but will they be able to save it in time?In Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R., players work together to challenge the forces of evil. Play as iconic heroes like Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Black Widow, and race across the globe to complete missions, battle enemies, and square off for the final showdown against the nemesis. Choose the best aspect for your hero, pull off awesome combos, and wait for the perfect moment to unleash your ultimate ability. Team up with your allies and take on dangerous threats as you become the greatest heroes in the world!In more detail, D.A.G.G.E.R. stands for Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Emergency Response, and the Alliance and Emergency Response elements drive how the game is played, with heroes needing to strengthen themselves via combos in time to take on the nemesis.There are two types of combo tokens: empowered tokens and primed tokens. When a hero becomes empowered, they can later discard their empowered token to add one success to any attribute test they perform. When an enemy is primed, a hero attacking that enemy can remove a primed token from them to add one success to the attack result, which means more damage dealt.What's more, each hero has at least one combo ability that requires either an empowered token on themselves or a primed token on an enemy to trigger. Triggering these combo abilities comes with an extra benefit: advancing the team-up track, a resource shared by all heroes that's used to pay for team-up abilities, the strongest abilities in each hero's arsenal.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 180 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Comic Book / StripMechanisme: Cooperative GameMakersOntwerper: Dane Beltrami]]>","boardgames","99.95","0","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24819-marvel-dagger.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/47146-home_default/marvel-dagger.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24819-marvel-dagger.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Fantasy Flight Games]]","99.95","0841333120207","FFMD01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2250.000000}"

You were gathering mercenaries from ruthless factions across the realm to battle it out and claim the dead kings throne. It was exactly what you wanted to be doing. However, your perfect life has become disrupted: an ancient threat from deep below has risen to claim the whole realm. Now, you must form an alliance with a former rival to defeat this otherworldly evil, so you can set things back to normal.Work together to fight and defeat the enemy. The game is played over 2 phases. In the first phase you recruit followers and select alliance cards. Alliance cards differs from enemies who you will have to fight and hourglasses which will give you time to think. In the second phase you will collect factions and of course fulfill the requirements of the alliance cards. If players succeed in commanding certain factions and defeat the enemies, they will win together and you can get back to the fight against each other.In Claim: Alliances players will follow the same flow as in a standard game. The game is played over 2 phases.Instead of winning the most factions, you now have to work together to defeat the enemies and win the favor of a couple of factions.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 25 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, FantasyMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Auction/Bidding, Auction: Once Around, Cooperative Game, Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Scott Almes]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24858-claim-alliances.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/47188-home_default/claim-alliances.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/24858-claim-alliances.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026305451","WGG2312","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#132.000000}"

Its clever structure of alternating rounds puts a fascinating twist on player interaction, card drafting, and resource management.Founded on the fruitful lands of an erstwhile monastery, two villages have held up the dual tradition of brewing beer and baking bread. While sharing fields and resources, they still find pride in their friendly rivalry of besting each others produce.Each of you represents one of these villages. Over the course of six years - which alternate between fruitful and dry - you must harmonize your duties of harvesting and storing resources, producing beer and bread, selling them for coins and upgrading your facilities.However, in order to win, you must maintain the balance between your baked and liquid goods. Because, after the sixth year, you only score the coins collected from the type of good - beer or bread - for which you earned less. The village with the higher score wins.description from publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Farming, MedievalMechanisme: Closed Drafting, Highest-Lowest Scoring, Multi-Use CardsMakersOntwerper: Scott Almes]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25058-brood-bier.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/47481-home_default/brood-bier.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25058-brood-bier.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","29.95","8720289474799","999-BRO01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#669.000000}"

The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new Obermufti of Marrakesh.Marrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board (these will be the actions they will perform later), then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. The cube tower randomizes which cylinders are available this round, with some getting stuck and some from previous rounds coming out.In turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Then, in turn order players will activate the regions where they have placed an assistant.Actions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city. Performing various actions also earns bonuses and enhances actions even more as the game proceeds. The player who scores the most points by the end of the game wins.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 120 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: City BuildingMechanisme: Cube Tower, End Game Bonuses, Open Drafting, Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Stefan Feld]]>","boardgames","75.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25135-marrakesh-essential-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/47768-home_default/marrakesh-essential-edition.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25135-marrakesh-essential-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","75.95","4010350244364","QNG20382E","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2684.000000}"

You split, they choose! Don't despair, though, because while your opponent is looking at your split, you also receive a similar offer from the player on your right, so choose wisely. When your hand is complete, play your cards to add all those riches to your collection.Each type of riches awards you prestige points in different ways, so maintain a balanced collection of gems, keep an eye on the value of the art market as it evolves, and pile up priceless tomes. Depending on how each player builds their collection, different riches will take on a different value for each of them. Show off your best haggling skills in crafting your split, and create the perfect offer to push your opponent to take what you want them to take...leaving you with the tastiest loot!Be prepared for when the mid-game scorings are triggered.

Your rightmost column is also considered to belong to your right-hand neighbor, and likewise your area includes the rightmost column of your left-hand neighbor. Each player reveals any two cards in their area, then the round begins.On a turn, you either draw the top card of the deck and reveal it, or draw the top card of the discard pile. If you draw from the discard pile, swap that card with any card in your area, then discard the replaced card. If you draw from the deck, you can discard that card (turning any card in your area face up) or you can swap that card with any card in your area.If you draw from the deck, any other player can knock on the table to indicate that they want this card. You can ignore the knock, or you can give them the card; in the latter case, they then replace one card in their area with this new card, taking the old card in their hand. You then take any one card in their area and swap it for a card in your area, discarding the replaced card. The other player then places the card in their hand into the hole you created when you took one of their cards.Any time you have three identical cards in a row or column  even a row that includes a card in your left neighbor's rightmost column!  you discard those cards from play.Whenever one player has all their cards face up, each other player takes one more turn, then players sum the value of the cards in their area (which includes any cards remaining their neighbor's rightmost column). If the player who triggered the end of the round doesn't have the lowest sum, their sum is doubled. The player with the lowest total score after three rounds wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, NumberMechanisme: Auction/Bidding, Deck Construction, Highest-Lowest Scoring, Pattern Building, Semi-Cooperative Game, Set Collection, Team-Based GameMakersOntwerper: Bella Lucca]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25205-allegra.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/47751-home_default/allegra.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25205-allegra.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","12.95","3701551701190","IEL70119","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#264.000000}"

Their goal is to keep up the hoop for as long as possible.This is represented by cards. The goal is to get rid of all of your cards; or make all other players drop out (drop their hoop).Each player starts with five cards in their hand, plus five cards openly in front of them. When it's their turn, they can choose to play one of their open cards or one from their hand. The first player plays any card and demands the next player to play higher or lower.

On a new, huge city map, which seamlessly follows the previous plans, 16 tricky crime cases are again waiting to be solved by one to four amateur detectives. These are brand new stories, more sophisticated and criminal than ever before! The aim is to determine motives, find evidence and convict the perpetrators. An attentive eye is just as much in demand as creative powers of deduction to unravel everything on the 75 x 110 cm game board. As a little help, a magnifying glass is included in the game and the individual cases are again marked with symbols, so that parents can decide which cases even the youngest investigators may investigate and uncover.

It's survival of the fittest as you compete to build the largest, most dominant pack by claiming territory, recruiting lone wolves, and hunting prey. But be careful not to expand too recklessly into terrain where your rivals thrive  they may lure members of your pack away.A clever action-selection mechanism drives your choices. Each action requires you to flip terrain tiles matching the terrain where you wish to take your action. These double-sided tiles mean the actions you take this round will set up which terrain types you can act on in the next round. As you take actions to expand your pack's control of each region, you also upgrade your pack's attributes, allowing you to take more aggressive actions as the game goes on.In three mid-game scoring phases, power is calculated in each region. At the end of the game, players tally points based on VP tokens earned in these scoring phases and the highest VP number revealed in each of the six tracks on your player board.

Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper  but at the risk of ending up with nothing.All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no one can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-8Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Adventure, Bluffing, ExplorationMechanisme: Move Through Deck, Push Your Luck, Score-and-Reset Game, Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Bruno Faidutti, Alan R.

When you draw, you take two cards from the face-down deck or the two face-up decks as you choose. You have a maximum hand size of ten cards, and when you discard, you can dump only cards of the same number.To tick off numbered boxes, you name a value from 1-12, then play cards from your hand, whether a single card matching that value or a pair of cards that sum to that value. Tick off one space in that row for each card or pair of cards you play. When you cross off the final box in a row, you gain an extra cross, which (if you play cleverly) might earn you another cross, and so on.After discarding or playing cards, if you have no cards in hand, draw five cards from the face-down pile.The first player to cross off all of the squares on their player sheet wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Hand ManagementMakersOntwerper: Karin Hetling]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25445-triggs.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/48090-home_default/triggs.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25445-triggs.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026305741","WGG2331","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#262.000000}"

The player who succeeds in doing this best becomes the new Obermufti of Marrakesh.Marrakesh is played over three rounds, with each round consisting of four turns. On each turn, players simultaneously and secretly choose three colored cylinders from behind their screen. Then, in turn order, they place matching colored assistants on their player board (these will be the actions they will perform later), then all cylinders are placed in the cube tower. The cube tower randomizes which cylinders are available this round, with some getting stuck and some from previous rounds coming out.In turn order, players select a color and take 1-2 of the cylinders that have passed through the tower (or those that were stuck from a previous round but have now emerged) and place them on their player boards. These cylinders will enhance future actions taken in the same color in future rounds. Then, in turn order players will activate the regions where they have placed an assistant.Actions allow players to gain wealth, which can be traded for influence in the city.

To set-up the game, remove three face-down cards from the deck of 45 cards from the game, then lay out two cards face up to start a line. Each round, each player receives five cards in hand, and each turn you either play one card from your hand to the end of the line or  once per round  collect the most recently played five cards. Once all the cards from hand have been played, deal out five cards to each player and start the next round.

Other cards are numbered 5-8, and you score 5-8 points for a value if you have more of those cards than the other player. Additionally, you score 5 points for each set of 5-8 that you've collected. And while normally points decide who wins, if you collect all three special cards  each of which are worthless on their own  you win immediately.The original edition saw players seeking the Holy Grail, with the assistance of various factions.

The game is played over eight rounds. At the beginning of the round, six colored dice are rolled, with players receiving a threat marker in the color of any die that rolls a 5 or 6. The black die is a wild threat, with players drawing a threat token with one of the other threat types hidden on the back. If a player ever has three of one type of threat, they receive a penalty.Next, players have the opportunity to pay a number of coins (equal to the pips on all diceshowing a 1 or 2) to advance on the mayor's track. The black die also activates the clergy in St.Michael's Church, which serves as a round counter and awards points for certain building types at the end of the game.On their turn, players play five cards from any of five stacks of cards, one for each of the five colors in the game. These cards are in thirteen categories, each representing a different location around Hamburg, with seventeen individual cards within each category. Each card in a player's hand may be used for a number of purposes, including building the city wall, activating boats (if a 3 or 4 is rolled), starting a building plot, and constructing a building (card) on the plot, with this building granting a new ability or endgame scoring condition.Players receive points for various accomplishments during the game. In addition, they may receive bonus points by being the only player to have achieved one of five conditions for that round.

One side of the sheet shows a roughly hexagonal grid composed of black hexes and blue and red circles (collectively spaces), while the other side has these hexes and circles arranged like a bear's head.On a turn, any player rolls the die, then you each must draw one of the shapes next to this die result e.g., a circle, two hexes, and another circle in a line  into the grid, then cross it out to indicate that you can't use it again. You can place the first shape anywhere, then all subsequent shapes you add must touch something you've drawn previously. If you've used both shapes for a number, you can choose any available shape, then cross it out. If you can't place a shape or decline to do so, you must still cross one out.After twelve die rolls, you will have three or more spaces still open (because the grid has 51 spaces). You then score penalty points for each unfilled space: 3 for red, 2 for blue, and 1 for black. Additionally you score 1 penalty point for each different area of unfilled spaces in your grid. Whoever has the fewest penalty points wins.As a variant for experience players, each player can fill in 0-3 spaces in their grid before starting play.

The sheet shows an island of hexes, with various spaces displaying shovels, footprints, treasures, and five colors of temples. Each player starts the game in a different harbor space on the island's perimeter.On a turn, the active player rolls a die, then each player moves that many spaces in a contiguous line, marking each space as you go. You can't re-enter spaces you've visited previously. If you pass through or land on shovels or footprints, you circle those icons on your player sheet. By crossing off a footprint, you can ignore the die and move 1-6 spaces.If you end your movement on a treasure, roll the die, and if the die result equals or exceeds the treasure value (4-6), you collect these points in one of your six scoring spaces. For each shovel you cross off, you can add 1 to the result of the die.If you end your movement on a temple, roll the die; if you have at least as many shovels as the number rolled, you score 9 points, and if you don't, you lose 1 point.

And you can't choose a goal you've already chosen, so things can get pretty tough especially on the last hand, where no matter what cards you're dealt, you *have* to go for whichever of the five goals you haven't done already.Since the game is always exactly five rounds, it lasts a good dependable half an hour every time.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  EngelsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Hand Management, Set Collection, Take That, Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","14.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25831-foodie-forest.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/48723-home_default/foodie-forest.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25831-foodie-forest.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[IELLO]]","14.95","3701551700049","IEL70004","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#306.000000}"

"ee735efb-9185-4dce-8a39-9b360ce6da03","<![CDATA[Ticket to Ride: Rails & sails (EN)]]","<![CDATA[Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe — which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.
As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.
Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)
Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.
Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.
Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.
Ticket to Ride: Rails  Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.

But the central hill only supports a certain number of goats with food.Every card has a number from 1 to 50 and from 1 to 5 goat's heads printed on it. At the start of the game, every player receives eight cards, and eight tricks are played in one game. There are also hill cards which have each two quarters of an island with a number between 1 and 8 written on it.The player who played the highest-numbered card wins the trick and is first player for the next. However, during the first four tricks, the player who played the lowest-numbered card, adds a part of the central hill to the middle of the table, marking it with the wooden goat. After the first four tricks, the players know how many goats the central hill supports. This represents the goal limit.The winner of the game is the player who collected the most goat's heads without going over the limit dictated by the central hill. A proven strategy is to spam your opponents with the goats that you probably won't need.A variant of the game consists of playing a number of rounds equal to the number of players, and totaling the points.Contains:- 50 playing cards- 12 hill cards- 1 wooden goat- 1 rule bookAlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Animals, Card GameMechanisme: Betting and Bluffing, Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Günter Burkhardt]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25968-bokken-schieten-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/48928-home_default/bokken-schieten-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/25968-bokken-schieten-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","12.95","8720289475871","999-BOK02","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#172.000000}"

The great Pharaoh Mino has passed, and rule passes to his eldest son: Pharoah Mido. Displeased with the plain appearance of the pyramid in which his father was buried, Mido turns his attention to his own legacy. He wishes for his own resting place to better reflect his majesty and has decreed that 2-4 architects build pyramids encrusted with jewels: a pyramido. The architect who builds the most impressive pyramido will be appointed Vizier and enjoy wealth and power beyond imagination.
Pyramido is a tile-placement game in which each stage of the pyramid creates connections between them. Players take turns choosing from the available dominoes to create their pyramid. To maximize their points, players must match the jewel icons on the dominoes and place their markers of the same colors to activate the scoring areas. Each choice of domino and its positioning has a significant impact since the previous stages influence the score throughout the game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.5) Loan - Take a 30 loan and reduce your income.Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.New Sell systemBrewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also grease the wheels of industry by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.Birmingham features three all-new industry types:Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to 8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, Post-Napoleonic, Trains, TransportationMechanisme: Hand Management, Income, Loans, Market, Network and Route Building, Tags, Tech Trees / Tech Tracks, Turn Order: Stat-Based, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: Gavan Brown, Matt Tolman, Martin Wallace]]>","boardgames","69.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26040-brass-birmingham-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49067-home_default/brass-birmingham-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26040-brass-birmingham-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","69.95","8718026305949","WGG2416","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2008.000000}"

To deal with the dilution of the deck, naturally caused by adding more cards, all sea cards feature a wave icon, and whenever it is revealed in the display, you discard the first card in the row, then replenish.A new fourth university is available on the association board, and if you take it, you claim one of six special universities from the reserve that feature one research icon and one of six animal icons. When you take this registry, you reveal cards from the top of the deck and keep the first revealed card with an animal icon that matches your chosen university.For each of the five action cards, four alternate versions with a little twist will be available. Players draft action cards at the start of play, replacing two of their standard action cards with these new ones, increasing the asymmetry in the game.New bonus tiles and final scoring cards will also be included.Also the expansion will include alternate wooden markers for the 3 tracks and cute animals to mark the conservation projects you support instead of using your regular player markers.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 90 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Expansion for Base-game, Animals, Economic, EnvironmentalMechanisme: End Game Bonuses, Hand Management, Hexagon Grid, Income, Open Drafting, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire Game, Tile Placement, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-upUitbreiding voor:  Ark NovaMakersOntwerper: Mathias Wigge]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26041-ark-nova-waterwereld-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49068-home_default/ark-nova-waterwereld-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26041-ark-nova-waterwereld-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","29.95","8718026305963","WGG2352","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#592.000000}"

Are you ready for a new adventure?Dragons, Treasures  Mysteries includes 3 new modules:The Treasures module provides new treasure chest tokens that each player receives at the start of the game. Each player will choose one to put somewhere on each of the terrain tiles. After all of the tokens are placed, they are flipped face up. If a player's explorer stops next to a token, they may meet a requirement, usually discarding a certain amount or total value of one color of card. If they fulfill the requirement, they receive the token. The token may be spent to move your explorer up to 2 spaces. However, if you collect 4 treasure chest tokens, you win the game immediately!The Dragons module contains 4 dragon pawns each in different colors corresponding to the cards' colors. The dragons start the game asleep and each on their own terrain tile. Once a player's explorer steps onto a terrain tile with a sleeping dragon, the dragon awakens and no one may walk through or next to it's space. However, once you play a card whose color matches the dragon, you may move the creature one space, potentially moving it out of your way and blocking your opponents! This module also includes new cards that allow players to perform actions relating to the dragons.The Mysteries module introduces new, smaller terrain tiles with dark mists. They are placed onto normal terrain tiles to add areas of mysterious fog. Once a player stops next to a mystery tile, it's flipped over and the layout underneath becomes visible. The player who uncovered the tile gains a bonus token and may then rotate and place it to create new terrain spots of jungle, water, etc. which are on the back of each mystery tile.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Expansion for Base-game, Adventure, Exploration, RacingMechanisme: Deck, Bag, and Pool Building, Delayed Purchase, Grid Movement, Hand Management, Hexagon Grid, Modular Board, Open Drafting, Race, Sudden Death Ending, Variable Player PowersUitbreiding voor:  The Quest for El DoradoMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","22.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26275-de-zoektocht-naar-el-dorado-draken-schatten-en-mysteries.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49372-home_default/de-zoektocht-naar-el-dorado-draken-schatten-en-mysteries.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26275-de-zoektocht-naar-el-dorado-draken-schatten-en-mysteries.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","22.95","8720289474836","999-ELD04","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#752.000000}"

The loss of so many people has created big problems for the survivors. Many of the people the villagers used to depend on for essential things like food, shelter and clothes are gone. Craftsmen find themselves without suppliers of raw materials, traders have lost their customers and many have lost their farms and workshops as they escaped the plague.The roads are full of refugees seeking a new beginning. They come to you, hoping to settle down on your land and make a living. Your grain farm is the ideal starting point for a village, reliably providing food for many people. You must choose wisely who you allow to settle with you, as your food and resources are limited.The people on the road have valuable and unique skills, but they all in turn rely on other people with very specific crafts to be able to work. Raw materials, tools and services must be provided by other people from the road.If you manage to find people that can work together to make a profit, while increasing your food surplus and capacity for building new houses, your village will be prosperous.The game comes with a solo mode where a lone village strives to prosper in spite of the dreaded Countess and her evil machinations.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, City Building, Industry / Manufacturing, MedievalMechanisme: Open Drafting, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Haakon Gaarder]]>","boardgames","24.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26465-villagers.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49632-home_default/villagers.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26465-villagers.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","24.95","8718026305406","WGG2326","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#676.000000}"

The player with the most points wins.In your turn, you have access to 5 action points, which you can use in different ways. For example, you can move your scouts, who may discover new terrain or pick up building materials. You can also choose to research the value of metal tokens or draw action cards. After spending your action points, you may build if you meet its conditions. Finally, you collect energy with scouts at solar panels. That energy is needed to deliver metal tokens to the central tile, with which you can eventually earn the most points and win the game!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Space ExplorationMechanisme: Action Points, Area Movement, Hand Management, Memory, Modular Board, Movement Points, Pick-up and Deliver, Point to Point Movement, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Klaus-Jürgen Wrede]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26468-exoplanet.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49636-home_default/exoplanet.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26468-exoplanet.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","49.95","8720289475963","999-EXO01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2048.000000}"

Each player has a hand six cards: two each of Loot (go for the card), Shoot (take a shot at their opponent), and Whiskey (grab the whiskey bottle). Players each secretly play one card on the two saloon cards closest to the deck, reveal and resolve those cards, then secret play on the next two saloon cards, resolve those, then refill the saloon layout to four cards. The outcome of these confrontations uses a rock-paper-scissors mechanism: Whiskey beats Shoot, with the winner gaining a separate, non-saloon whiskey card or (if they already have it) flipping it over to drink it; if you win whiskey three times without the opponent taking back the bottle, then you finish the bottle and win. Shoot beats Loot, with the shooting player taking a hit card as a badge of honor. If you collect four hit cards, you win. Loot beats Whiskey, with the winner claiming the current saloon card. If this card is a shoot or whiskey, then you resolve those cards as described above; if this card shows gold nuggets, you collect those nuggets, and if you have collected nine or more nuggets, you win.In case of a tie, discard the saloon card.If someone doesn't win the game instantly as described above, then the game ends when you can't refill the saloon to four cards. In this case, whoever has the whiskey bottle on their side of the board wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 5 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: American WestMechanisme: Rock-Paper-Scissors, Simultaneous Action SelectionMakersOntwerper: Moritz Dressler]]>","boardgames","7.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26471-minnys-loot-shoot-whisky.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49639-home_default/minnys-loot-shoot-whisky.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26471-minnys-loot-shoot-whisky.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","7.95","8718026305680","WGG2323","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#58.000000}"

You combine two of these half puzzle pieces to craft your own dominoes. This mechanism is meant to provide more variability and randomization in each play.Instead of building your landscape around a central castle, you start from the river and expand away from it. Also, the crowns (i.e., the victory point multiplier) from Kingdomino are replaced by cow meeples, with players being able to use cowboys to move them.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Engels, FransSoort spelType/Thema: American West, Territory BuildingMechanisme: Open Drafting, Tile Placement, Turn Order: Stat-BasedMakersOntwerper: Bruno Cathala, Yohan Servais]]>","boardgames","28.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26572-moon-river.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/49897-home_default/moon-river.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26572-moon-river.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Blue Orange]]","28.95","3664824001857","BLU-02311","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#946.000000}"

Gardeners tend the pond, where the koi carp live, warriors stand guard on the walls, and courtiers crowd the gates, pining for an audience that brings them closer to the innermost circles of the court. When night falls, the lanterns are lit and the workers return to their clan.In The White Castle, players will control one of these clans in order to score more victory points than the rest. To do so, they must amass influence in the court, manage resources boldly, and place their workers in the right place at the right time. The authors are Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero, the duo known as Llama Dice who also designed the successful The Red Cathedral with Devir. In this case, we leave the Moscow of Ivan the Terrible behind to explore the most imposing fortress in modern Japan, Himeji Castle, where the banner of the Sakai clan flies under the orders of Daimio Sakai Tadakiyo.The White Castle is a Euro type game with mechanics of resource management, worker placement and dice placement to carry out actions. During the game, over three rounds, players will send members of their clan to tend the gardens, defend the castle or progress up the social ladder of the nobility. At the end of the match, these will award players victory points in a variety of ways.The central panel shows Himeji Castle in all its splendor, divided into several zones. The largest is inside the castle, with the Room of the Thousand Carpets, where the courtiers must ascend socially until they reach the circle closest to the Daimio to enjoy his favor. There is also the pond and the gardens, patiently tended by the gardeners where everyone can relax and contemplate its beauty without restriction. Another important area is the wall and the outside of the castle, where the warriors patrol and stand guard. Finally, we find the area of the three bridges, where the three types of dice that can be used to carry out actions are accumulated, and the personal domain of each player, where they will keep track of their resources and where they will have the reserve of workers.With accessible rules and a very careful setting, The White Castle is a very versatile title that will fit in with different gaming groups.

It features:     The (3D wooden) buildings and walls are now separated.     Guards as a new mechanic, which make choosing and constructing buildings more exciting and introduce new powerful extra actions that might bring you closer to victory!Each player constructs their own Alhambra by taking money cards and using these to purchase buildings of different types. Which buildings you can build are displayed on the building market. Unlike the base game of Alhambra, the buildings are not printed on the tiles, but instead players draw a tile and then a chip which tells them which of the wooden buildings is placed onto the tile. In each of the three scoring rounds, players will receive points if they have the most of each building type, as well as points for their longest connected wall segment.When buying a tile, players check for guard icons on the walls, placing one guard on each icon. The guards do two things:     Guards standing on your longest wall give you bonus points during scoring.     They can be discarded to do powerful extra actions during your turn.The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.Note: All existing expansions for Alhambra can be added to Red Palace except currently the tile based expansions from the Mega Box are not compatible due to the different size of the tiles (45mm vs 50mm)AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: City Building, MedievalMechanisme: Hand Management, Set Collection, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Dirk Henn]]>","boardgames","57.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26944-alhambra-red-palace-20-years-anniversary-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/50498-home_default/alhambra-red-palace-20-years-anniversary-edition.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26944-alhambra-red-palace-20-years-anniversary-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","57.95","4010350107737","QNG26123","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2068.000000}"

It challenges players to build combinations of abilities, as well as to correctly calculate the advantage of delayed gratification for actions.In the game, players are merchants in Amsterdam near the turn of the 20th century. At the start of the game, two district cards are placed on each of the twelve spaces on the designated board. At the beginning of a round, the next two district cards, as well as two building and two profession cards (each from a deck of 54 of each type) are drawn to form the offer of six cards. Each of these cards has a cost in colored action cubes and grants a new action, special ability, or way to score points. In turn order, each player takes a card from those on offer. Finally, a market card is revealed that allows players to exchange money for victory points on their turn.Next, the six colored dice are rolled. Each player decides which of the six dice they would like (players may choose the same die), then takes as many action cubes in that color as the number of pips. Players place their new action cubes on their rotatable windrose as many spaces in the future as the number on the dice. Finally, the wheel is spun, so that players gain access to all cubes that were located on the 1 space of their windrose.Action cubes are used to purchase cards that a player has taken, claim one of the nine types of goods around the city of Amsterdam, and ferry goods or workers through canals to warehouses. Players earn points for delivering their goods, as well as for bonuses on cards they purchase, and the player with the most points at the end of the twelfth round wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  Engels, Duits, FransSoort spelType/Thema: DiceMechanisme: Action Points, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Pick-up and Deliver, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Stefan Feld]]>","boardgames","76.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26945-amsterdam-essential-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/50499-home_default/amsterdam-essential-edition.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/26945-amsterdam-essential-edition.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Queen Games]]","76.95","4010350264584","QNG26458","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2516.000000}"

Each type of plant they replace gives a special ability or one-time benefit.

Unlike the base game of Alhambra, the buildings are not printed on the tiles, but instead players draw a tile and then a chip which tells them which of the wooden buildings is placed onto the tile. In each of the three scoring rounds, players will receive points if they have the most of each building type, as well as points for their longest connected wall segment.When buying a tile, players check for guard icons on the walls, placing one guard on each icon. The guards do two things:     Guards standing on your longest wall give you bonus points during scoring.     They can be discarded to do powerful extra actions during your turn.The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.Note: All existing expansions for Alhambra can be added to Red Palace except currently the tile based expansions from the Mega Box are not compatible due to the different size of the tiles (45mm vs 50mm)AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: City Building, MedievalMechanisme: Hand Management, Set Collection, Tile PlacementMakersOntwerper: Dirk Henn]]>","boardgames","58.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27059-alhambra-het-rode-paleis.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/50664-home_default/alhambra-het-rode-paleis.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27059-alhambra-het-rode-paleis.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","58.95","8718026306021","WGG2342","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1964.000000}"

Zauberberg, you want to move the sorcerers' apprentices down the mountain ahead of the witches  but you don't always know how the will-o'-the-wisps will make the figures move.To set up, place supports on the game board to elevate the starting area, then place six sorcerers' apprentices in the back row and four witches on their designated starting spaces. Add the five colored will-o'-the-wisp marbles to the bag.On a turn, draw a will-o'-the-wisp, then place it at the top of one of the six starting channels and let it go. If the will-o'-the-wisp hits a figure, the ball will stop. Pick up this figure and move it to the next open colored space on the winding path that matches the color of the will-o'-the-wisp. If you're moving a sorcerers' apprentice, you might want to do it quickly because if the will-o'-the-wisp hits that same figure, you can move it once again! Don't rush moving the witches, though, since you want them to move as little as possible. If a will-o'-the-wisp doesn't hit any figures, then you must move a witch of your choice to the next matching colored space. Once all five will-o'-the-wisps have been drawn, return them to the bag and start again.If you manage to move four sorcerers' apprentices to the bottom of the mountain before three witches get there, you win! You can adjust the difficulty of the game by requiring more sorcerers' apprentices or fewer witches or both. Alternatively, you can play the game competitively, with each player or team trying to get their group of four figures down the mountain first.[Admin note: Magic Mountain is listed for 2-6 players, whereas Zauberberg is listed for 1-4 players, but the gameplay seems identical in both releases.]AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-6Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 5+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Children's GameMechanisme: Cooperative Game, Team-Based GameMakersOntwerper: Jens-Peter Schliemann, Bernhard Weber]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27177-magische-berg.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/50850-home_default/magische-berg.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27177-magische-berg.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","29.95","8720289475529","999-MGB01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#980.000000}"

In the midday heat, the players take on the role of crooks on nimble prairie dog paws on the prowl. And neither carriages nor the vaults guarded by the sheriff are safe from them. Which of the players will manage to scam the most money through cleverly planned moves, good card management and a little luck?In Showdown players either use their turn to take a new card or play cards from their hand. A card always show 2 out of 5 possible actions. When playing cards players can play a number of cards of their choosing as long as all played cards share the same symbol and that symbol is visible at least 3 times on all cards played.The active player then activate ALL symbols on the played cards, grouped and in order of their choosing.The symbols have a variety of possible actions and let you move your bandit to the next spot or send the sherif off to guard the next vault of the bank in the middle of the board. Players can steal from a carrier or from other players by rolling dice and players can even save some of that well earned money so it can't be taken away from them ever again.But the sheriff of Slingshot Canyon is always vigilant and once he reaches his lookout, players not in hiding or in disguise will lose some precious coins. As the game progresses the path the sheriff takes gets shorter and shorter and players have to play their hands smart to not lose it all.

Which of the players will manage to scam the most money through cleverly planned moves, good card management and a little luck?In Showdown players either use their turn to take a new card or play cards from their hand. A card always show 2 out of 5 possible actions. When playing cards players can play a number of cards of their choosing as long as all played cards share the same symbol and that symbol is visible at least 3 times on all cards played.The active player then activate ALL symbols on the played cards, grouped and in order of their choosing.The symbols have a variety of possible actions and let you move your bandit to the next spot or send the sherif off to guard the next vault of the bank in the middle of the board. Players can steal from a carrier or from other players by rolling dice and players can even save some of that well earned money so it can't be taken away from them ever again.But the sheriff of Slingshot Canyon is always vigilant and once he reaches his lookout, players not in hiding or in disguise will lose some precious coins. As the game progresses the path the sheriff takes gets shorter and shorter and players have to play their hands smart to not lose it all. The player who leaves the Showdown of Slingshot Canyon the richest, wins the game.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, Frans, Spaans, ItaliaansSoort spelType/Thema: American WestMechanisme: Take ThatMakersOntwerper: Benjamin Schwer]]>","boardgames","26.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27234-showdown.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/50946-home_default/showdown.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27234-showdown.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Haba]]","26.95","4010168265681","HAB-1307147005","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#478.000000}"

Each villain has a unique battlefield with unique objectives. If the villain completes their objective (or defeats the heroes), the players lose. The villains are aided by a number of possible minions: Jersey Devil, Ant Queen, Loveland Frog, The Blob, Tarantula, and Skunk Ape. The enemies use special action cards and a simple targeting scheme to control their movement and attacks.The set comes with four new heroes: Nikola Tesla discharges his electrified coils to power up his effects; Annie Christmas gets stronger when she's fighting from behind; The Golden Bat, the world's first superhero, has a variety of powerful effects; and Dr. Jill Trent, Science Sleuth, calls on a collection of gizmos.Keeping to the Unmatched brand, you may use heroes from other Unmatched sets in Unmatched Adventures, and you can use the included heroes and battlefields to play competitive Unmatched.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 9+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Fantasy, Fighting, Mythology, Novel-basedMechanisme: Action Points, Campaign / Battle Card Driven, Card Play Conflict Resolution, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Line of Sight, Multi-Use Cards, Point to Point Movement, Solo / Solitaire Game, Variable Player PowersMakersOntwerper: Jason Hager, Darren Reckner]]>","boardgames","69.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27647-unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/51554-home_default/unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27647-unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","69.95","8718026305925","WGG2348","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1784.000000}"

The row contains the digits 1-6 in a random order, and each player should have a different sheet from among the twelve designs in the box.On a turn, the active player rolls the six colored dice, one for each of the colored rows. If they don't like the results, they can re-roll all six dice once. After the final die roll, for each die, each player can choose to mark off the leftmost available number matching the die result, skipping over any intervening numbers. Skipped numbers cannot be marked in the future. Thus, on each turn, each player makes 0-6 marks on their player sheet. The active player then passes the dice left.The final three columns on a player sheet are designated the ""target area"". If any player marks two spaces in a single row in the target area, that die is removed from the game at the end of that turn. When the third die is removed from play, the game ends.Each player then scores each row and each column on their player sheet, losing 5 points if only one mark is present, scoring 0 points for zero or two marks, and score 5+ points for 3+ marks.

"9be960ee-bcf4-4de0-9ad4-c7172349b2c3","<![CDATA[Spirit Island (NL)]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present. The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history. At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 90 min.Leeftijd: 13+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Environmental, Fantasy, Fighting, Mythology, Territory BuildingMechanisme: Action Retrieval, Area Majority / Influence, Automatic Resource Growth, Campaign / Battle Card Driven, Cooperative Game, Hand Management, Modular Board, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, Solo / Solitaire Game, Tags, Variable Player Powers, Variable Set-upMakersOntwerper: R.

The deck contains cards numbered 0-14 in five colors, and at the start of a round players are dealt a hand of 11-15 cards, then the top card of the deck is revealed to designate a trump suit. Each player then simultaneously chooses a card from their hand to predict the number of tricks they'll win this round, then places this card face down on the table.In general, standard trick-taking rules apply: Someone leads a card, and other players must follow suit, if possible, with the highest trump or highest card of the suit lead winning the trick. That said, some cards have special effects when played:     When you play a 0, you can treat it as a 0 of that color, or you can remove the 0 and one previously played card from the current trick.    A trick with a 4 in it is won by the lowest card played instead of the highest; a second 4 cancels this effect.    The 6 and 9 are on the same card, and you declare which value you want when playing it (or when using it to predict the number of tricks you'll win).    When you start a trick with an 8, you can peek at the prediction card of whoever wins that trick.    If a trick contains at least one 12, the trick's winner can choose to immediately split the cards in that trick to count as two tricks.At the end of the round, if you've collected as many tricks as you predicted at the start of the round, you score that many points. If you failed to collect that number, you lose as many points as the difference between your prediction and what you collected, e.g., if you predicted 5 and collected 4 or 6 tricks, you lose 1 point. After the designated number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 30 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  Nederlands, Engels, Duits, Frans, Spaans, PortugeesSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Trick-takingMakersOntwerper: Robert Brouwer]]>","boardgames","9.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27874-6th-sense-da-en.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/51966-home_default/6th-sense-da-en.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27874-6th-sense-da-en.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Jumbo]]","9.95","8710126198216","JUM9821","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#178.000000}"

Compete as master architects to acquire cards and use them to build the highest towers. You’ll get cards if you are willing to take more than everyone else. But since you can only build one tower of each of the 5 types, taking too many cards at once can limit your options in the long run.

(NL)]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.Your goal as a team in Get It! is to play all of your cards in ascending numerical order. Sounds easy, doesn't it? However, you have only one minute to do so, and you are not allowed to speak...and you can't see your own cards  only the cards of the other players! Can you give the right signals and interpret your teammates' signals correctly to play everything in time?To win, you need to complete six levels of play. For level 1, deal out ten cards from a deck numbered 1-40 as evenly as possible. Sort the cards face down (without showing anyone else) to stack the cards from low to high. Each player picks up their topmost card facing away from themselves so that it's visible to everyone else, then someone starts the timer. Whoever has the lowest card must play it. How will they know? Tell them with your eyes! If they play the card correctly, they pick up their next card, then you all figure out who plays next; if not, restart the level, losing the game if you fail a second time.If you complete the level by playing all cards correctly, add the special cards for level 2  smile cards  and deal 13 cards. Special cards can be stacked anywhere in a player's pile other than the topmost card. When a player holds a special card, that's considered the lowest card in play. Each level adds new special cards, such as the mirror and a second copy of some number cards, and more cards dealt to players. Make it through 25 cards in one minute at level 6, and you win!AlgemeenAantal spelers: 3-6Speelduur: 20 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, Deduction, Party GameMechanisme: Team-Based GameMakersOntwerper: Steffen Benndorf]]>","boardgames","12.5","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27879-get-it-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/51984-home_default/get-it-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/27879-get-it-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.5","8718026306014","WGG2405","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#152.000000}"

At the same time, everyone declares which column of cards they want to take. If no one else has claimed that column, take the cards and add them to your collection; if two or more player choose the same column, discard the final card of that column, then all tied players simultaneously declare a column number once again. Keep going until all players have taken cards from a column.Refill the columns to three cards each, then play another round. When a player has collected at least 13 cards at the end of a round, score everyone's collection, with ties being friendly:    Kings score based on how many you have: (n-1) points.    Knights are 1 point each, unless you have the most in which case they're 2 points each.    Churches give 10 points to whoever has collected the most.And so on. Some cards bear an X, and these cards are discarded after the first scoring. Players then continue playing rounds until the deck runs out, then players score for their collection once again.

The great Pharaoh Mino has passed, and rule passes to his eldest son: Pharoah Mido. Displeased with the plain appearance of the pyramid in which his father was buried, Mido turns his attention to his own legacy. He wishes for his own resting place to better reflect his majesty and has decreed that 2-4 architects build pyramids encrusted with jewels: a pyramido. The architect who builds the most impressive pyramido will be appointed Vizier and enjoy wealth and power beyond imagination.
Pyramido is a tile-placement game in which each stage of the pyramid creates connections between them. Players take turns choosing from the available dominoes to create their pyramid. To maximize their points, players must match the jewel icons on the dominoes and place their markers of the same colors to activate the scoring areas. Each choice of domino and its positioning has a significant impact since the previous stages influence the score throughout the game.

You are an amateur dracologist in the world of Wyrmspan, a place where dragons of all shapes, sizes, and colors roam the skies. Excavate a hidden labyrinth you recently unearthed on your land and entice these beautiful creatures to roost in the sanctuary of your caves.
During a game of Wyrmspan, you will build a sanctuary for dragons of all shapes and sizes. Your sanctuary begins with 3 excavated spaces—the leftmost space in your Crimson Cavern, your Golden Grotto, and your Amethyst Abyss. Over the course of the game, you will excavate additional spaces in your sanctuary and entice dragons to live there, chaining together powerful abilities and earning the favor of the Dragon Guild.
Wyrmspan is inspired by the mechanisms of Wingspan, though its unique elements make Wyrmspan a standalone game (not compatible with Wingspan).

The newly crowned ruler, El Cascadero, seeks to reunite the land, but he cant do it alone. Thus, he appoints four ministers to visit the people and restore civil harmony. While the ministers are obligated to bring prosperity to the entire land, each of them also has one dedicated responsibility: Farming, Crafting, Mining, and Markets.  El Cascadero also records in his book the successes of his ministersCascadero is the next epic tile placement strategy game from acclaimed designer Reiner Knizia.  Ministers visit towns by placing their envoys adjacent to them; but towns are distrusting of single envoys, so newly placed envoys will only trigger town scoring when they are part of an established group or carry an official seal from El Cascadero himself. Towns with Royal Messengers at them or a history of envoy visits are even more valuable, as they willingly collaborate for even greater successes.Players must decide between two competing strategies: build long chains of their envoys to achieve synergies and objectives, or establish smaller, separate groups of envoys to trigger timely town scoring. Both will award victory points, yet your victory points will mean nothing if you dont also reach the end of your appointed success column.By triggering town scoring, youll advance along that towns matching success column, gaining bonuses as you pass over them.  Bonuses include earning victory points, advancing further on any success column, claiming an official seal, repositioning an envoy, or even acquiring an additional turn. Through careful timing and clever plans, players can trigger a cascading combo of exciting bonuses that swing momentum in their favor.Cascadero provides a wealth of replayability through emergent player interaction, variable board and tile setups, and an advanced player mode featuring traveling heralds.  Yet the game will always end in one of two ways: when one player reaches fifty victory points or must place a tile but has no tiles left.  The players who reached the end of their appointed success column qualify for victory, and whoever among them has the most victory points wins.description from the publisherAlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 14+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: RenaissanceMechanisme: Chaining, Connections, Hexagon Grid, Once-Per-Game Abilities, Tile Placement, Track MovementMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","49.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/28173-cascadero.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/52531-home_default/cascadero.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/28173-cascadero.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","49.95","8718026306342","WGG2434","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#3500.000000}"

Each player starts with 10 bananas, and the first lot up for bid is 10 bananas. You can secretly bid any amount for this lot  even far above 10 bananas!Players then reveal their bids, and if the player who bid the most can pay the difference between their bid and the next lowest bid, they pay this difference to whoever made that bid, then they win the current lot, adding it to their banana stash; if they can't, they lose bananas equal to their bid! (A player will always have a minimum of 10 bananas, though.)You then compare the player with the second-highest bid and the player with the third-highest bid, etc. Eventually either someone wins and pays their bid, or everyone has been reduced to having 10 bananas. In a tie, players split the banana pot.The next lot is for an amount of bananas equal to whoever has the most bananas.

The player sheet has a 3x3 grid of 2x2 squares with the numbers 1-6 being placed in six of the 36 spaces; the A side has a number of blue bridges that link two blue spaces in adjacent squares, while all of the other spaces are white, whereas the B side has six spaces in each of five colors, apart from the starting 1-6 digits.On a turn, any player rolls the two six-sided dice. On the A side, you place the die results in any two empty white spaces or in the blue spaces that make up a bridge. On the B side, you place the die results in two empty spaces of the same color.After fifteen turns, all of the spaces are filled, and you total your score, earning:    1 point for a square with four different digits    2 points for an adjacent pair of numbers    3 points for two adjacent pairs of numbers    4 points for two pairs of numbers placed diagonally in a square    5 points for four identical numbers    6 points for a straight of numbers in clockwise orderIf you score all six types of formations, you receive a bonus of 7 points.

But when is the best time to score...?The card deck consists of 55 double-sided cards. The digits 0-10 appear in every combination on these cards, with the digits always differing. Players start with 7-8 cards in hand depending on the player count. On a turn, you do one of two things, looking only at the side of the cards facing you:    Discard a straight of exactly three cards with consecutive numbers, or    Discard one or more cards of the same value.End your turn by drawing one card from the deck and adding it to your hand. If you have played exactly three cards with the same number, each other player must flip a zero in their hand to the other side or draw a card from the deck.Each time you draw a card, you can place it in your hand with the already revealed side facing you or flip it to the other side, after which you can't flip it back.If a player has only zeroes in their hand at the end of their turn, they reveal them to end the round immediately. Otherwise, a player can choose to knock to end the round, after which each other player can take one final turn. No matter how the round ends, players then sum the value of cards in their hand. The player with the lowest sum scores 0 points, while everyone else scores their sum; if a player knocked, then didn't have the lowest sum, they score a 5-point penalty in addition to their sum.Play multiple rounds until a player has 50+ points, at which time the player with the lowest score wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-6Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card GameMechanisme: Hand Management, Take ThatMakersOntwerper: Reinhard Staupe, Jannik Walter]]>","boardgames","12.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/28243-quando-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/52637-home_default/quando-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/28243-quando-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","12.95","8718026306250","WGG2425","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#160.000000}"

De spelers kruipen in de huid van 2 kwakzalvers, die met veel bombarie en geschreeuw om de aanwezige toeschouwers strijden. Aan beide kanten is uiterste concentratie vereist, want elke actie wordt nauwkeurig door de concurrent geobserveerd. Beide spelers proberen de nog twijfelende patiënten naar hun kraam te lokken, want elke patiënt die een speler behandelt, geeft hem meer aanzien in het gildenhuis van de kwakzalvers. Wie van jullie wordt de volgende gildenmeester van de Kwakzalvers van Kakelenburg?

Wie speelt er De Kwakzalvers van Kakelenburg: Het Duel?
Deze versie van het bekende bordspel “De Kwakzalvers van Kakelenburg” is uitsluitend geschikt voor 2 spelers, maar biedt meer interactie en onderlinge strijd dan het basisspel. Wie dus houdt van het beproeven van zijn geluk, het dwarszitten van zijn tegenstander en het uitproberen van verschillende tactieken, komt in dit spel helemaal aan zijn trekken. 
Hoe speel je De Kwakzalvers van Kakelenburg: Het Duel?
De spelers proberen patiënten uit het park naar hun marktkraam te lokken. Beiden hebben een fles, waarin plaats voor verschillende fiches is, en een buidel met fiches. Ben je aan de beurt, dan trek je fiches totdat je vrijwillig stopt of je fles ontploft. Afhankelijk van het resultaat mag je de patiënt of zelfs je marktkraam verplaatsen. Bereikt de patiënt je marktkraam, dan mag je die behandelen en vertrekt de volgende patiënt.Na het voltooien van hun drank mogen de spelers nieuwe fiches kopen. Elk fiche heeft bepaalde eigenschappen, die dan wel direct, dan wel later in een ronde worden geactiveerd. Heeft een speler zijn zesde patiënt behandeld, dan heeft hij direct gewonnen. Het spel eindigt ook na ronde 7. Dan wint de speler die de meeste patiënten heeft behandeld. 
Waarom kies je voor De Kwakzalvers van Kakelenburg: Het Duel van 999 Games?

"82fe136d-8756-41d9-937b-5736aa1105af","<![CDATA[Stapelstad]]","<![CDATA[Van dit Nederlandstalige spel is momenteel alleen een Engelse beschrijving beschikbaar.In Sunrise Lane, players take on the role of construction companies attempting to build up a residential neighborhood, and to do this, they need to pick prestigious plots of land on which to build houses and town structures.            In more detail, the game board depicts a grid of spaces that each show 1-5 dots in a single color, and each player has a set of colored House pieces, with the colors having no connection to the space on the board. On a turn, you either draw 2 colored cards from the deck and add them to your hand (with a limit of 5 cards in hand) or discard cards to place a building, then draw a card.            When you build, you must build adjacent to a pre-existing structure (or the central space at the start of the game), and you must discard 1 or more cards of the same color as the dots in the space on which you want to build. You can discard 1-5 cards, after which you place 1-5 of your House pieces on this space, then score points equal to the number of dots on the space multiplied by the number of House pieces you placed. You can build multiple buildings on a turn as long as you build your next one adjacent to the last one you built.            When a player has 2 or less House pieces in their supply, the game ends, then players score endgame points, with two of the districts awarding points for the highest buildings and the other two for the most buildings. Additionally, points go to the player with the longest group of adjacent buildings.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2-4Speelduur: 45 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, City BuildingMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Chaining, End Game Bonuses, Hand ManagementMakersOntwerper: Reiner Knizia]]>","boardgames","39.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/28420-stapelstad.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/52907-home_default/stapelstad.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/28420-stapelstad.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","39.95","8718026306120","WGG2413","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#860.000000}"

Each variant must be played on its own, not combined with another. They are: Even/Odd: During set-up, place a double-sided even/odd card to the left of the lowest starting card, placing it even or odd side face up to match that card. Only cards of the same type can be added to that row, so if the card is on odd, then even cards can be placed only on the other three rows. If you take the row next to this card, move this card next to the row with the lowest number at right, flipping it if needed. Mountain Climbing: During set-up, place a double-sided card to the left of the bottommost starting card with the face showing the up arrow in the corner and down arrow on a row of cards. Cards placed in this row go in descending order instead of ascending. If you play 35 and the descending row ends in 40 and an ascending row ends in 28, you'll place your card in the descending row since the difference between 35  40 is less than between 35  20. If you take this row, slide the double-sided card up to the next row; when it reaches the top row, it then starts moving back down. The Jumping Cow: During set-up, place the jumping cow card to the right of the lowest starting card; this card counts as part of this row. When someone places the sixth card in this row, they claim the number cards other than the one they played, then the cow immediately jumps to the end of the row with the lowest number at right; if this row now has six cards, they claim these cards as well! Number Spinner: During set-up, each player takes a number spinner card along with ten number cards. Once during the round, they can play the number spinner along with a two-digit number card. During card placement, the digits on this player's card are reversed, e.g. 41 becomes 14, so if 14 is the lowest number, they place their card first. However, once placed, the digits are treated in their original order for all subsequent card placements. Beat the Buffalo: This co-operative variant is for 1-6 players, who try to score less collectively than the buffalo. During set-up, deal ten cards face down to the buffalo board; additionally, take 0-16 random action cards depending on the player count, then lay two of them face up. Each turn, all players choose and reveal their cards, then flip the buffalo's top number card. All of the cards are placed in the rows like normal, but at any time before, during, or after this process, players can choose to use one or more action cards, replacing each with a new card immediately. Action cards let you make a row off-limits, place a card inside a row, move an already placed card, and more.

On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on top, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect chips based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white chips (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black chip (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white chips for one black chip at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one chip (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.L.A.M.A. Kadabra adds four new elements to the gameplay described above: Double cards: Some cards show two numbers: 2/3 and 4/5. You can play a 2/3 on a 1, a 2, or a 3, so they give you more flexibility, but if you end the round with one in hand, it counts as both numbers when you're collecting chips. Action cards: When you play a 1, give one of your lowest chips  yes, including a black chip if that's all you have  to any player who hasn't yet quit. When you play a card with a rectangle on it, the next player to take a turn must draw a card, then take their turn as normal. The magic chip: When you play a card with a star, claim the lone blue magic chip from whoever currently holds it. On a future turn, you can discard the chip to skip your turn. If you hold this chip (and no white ones) when you play a 1, give this to another player. If you hold the magic chip at the end of the round, it's worth 10 points. The magic show: Whenever you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage. When the magic stage has at least five chips on it, the magic show begins. During a magic show, if you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage; if you can't or don't want to play a llama, take all of the chips on stage to end the magic show, then take your turn as normal.The game ends at the end of the round where at least one player has forty or more total points.

As brave explorers, cartographers and astronomers, players set off from Baghdad to map the surrounding land, waterways, and heavens above. Players must carefully manage their caravan of workers and equipment, while reporting back regularly to journal their findings at the House of Wisdom. Will you succeed in impressing the Caliph, or lose your way and succumb to the wilderness?The aim of Wayfarers of the South Tigris is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at the game's end. Points are primarily gained by mapping the land, water, and sky. Players can also gain points from upgrading their caravans, by gaining inspiration from nobles, and by influencing the three guilds of science, trade and exploration. As they make discoveries, players will want to quickly journal their progress.

Partyspel voor grote groepen!

Ontmasker de Weerwolven wordt door een spelleider gestuurd. Iedere speler krijgt een rol toebedeeld. Het kan gaan om gewone burgers en weerwolven, maar ook om speciale karakters als de barbier, de zieneres of de schutter. Ieder karakter doet iets speciaals. 
De spelleider geeft ’s nachts aan dat iedereen zijn ogen moet dichtdoen en roept steeds de karakters op, die dan hun eigenschap mogen uitvoeren. De weerwolven elimineren aan het einde van de nacht een burger. Als het weer dag wordt, bespreken de burgers in een vergadering de gebeurtenissen van de afgelopen nacht en mogen ze proberen om een weerwolf te elimineren. Maar omdat de weerwolven zelf ook aan de vergadering deelnemen, is die beslissing meestal niet eenvoudig…
Ontmasker de Weerwolven is een ideaal spel voor op kinderpartijtjes, kampeerevenementen en eigenlijk al die momenten dat je met veel mensen bent. Zeker als je er in slaagt om met kaarsen of een kampvuur een mysterieuze sfeer te creëren, is succes verzekerd.
Waarom wil je dit spelen?
• Spannend partyspel
• Geschikt voor grote groepen
• Met fascinerende variant
Dit is een nieuwe versie van het bekende partyspel, die door 999 Games in eigen beheer is ontwikkeld en wordt uitgegeven. Ontmasker de Weerwolven bevat nieuwe rollen en spelregels voor een variant waarin de spelleider de identiteit van uitgeschakelde spelers niet bekend maakt.

Coördineer jullie acties en bereid je voor op de landing!
In dit coöperatieve spel spelen jullie een team piloten dat hun passagiersvliegtuig op vliegvelden over de hele wereld moet laten landen. Maar dat is absoluut niet zo eenvoudig als je denkt! Jullie moeten met de verkeerstoren communiceren om er zeker van te zijn dat de aanvliegroute vrij is van luchtverkeer, jullie snelheid aanpassen om de luchthaven niet te passeren, jullie vliegtuig in balans brengen om parallel aan de grond te landen, jullie kleppen bedienen om de opwaartse kracht te verhogen en steiler te kunnen landen, jullie landingsgestel bedienen om een veilige landing te garanderen en tot slot te remmen om na de landing het vliegtuig tot stilstand te kunnen brengen. Samenwerking en stalen zenuwen zijn vereist om te slagen!
Wie speelt er Sky Team?Zijn jullie met z’n tweeën, hebben jullie altijd al een vliegtuig willen besturen en is de sfeer beter als jullie niet tegen maar met elkaar spelen? Haal dan snel Sky Team in huis. Hoewel het spel coöperatief is, moet je veel beslissingen zelf nemen omdat de spelers tijdens het spel ten eerste niet mogen communiceren en ten tweede de geworpen dobbelstenen niet zichtbaar zijn voor de andere speler. De spelregels zijn relatief eenvoudig, maar de beslissingen die jullie moeten nemen, maken het spel zeer uitdagend! 
Hoe speel je Sky Team?In Sky Team proberen jullie als piloot en copiloot in 7 ronden jullie vliegtuig veilig te laten landen. Eerst kiezen jullie een vliegveld en een scenario. Elke ronde mogen jullie dan kort overleggen voordat jullie met de dobbelstenen gooien. Vanaf dat moment is er geen communicatie meer toegestaan en mogen jullie elkaars dobbelstenen ook niet zien. Om beurten leggen jullie een dobbelsteen op bijvoorbeeld de motoren, vliegtuigkleppen, het landingsgestel of de as. Elke gelegde dobbelsteen heeft zijn eigen voorwaarden en gevolgen. Jullie proberen daarbij met elkaar samen te werken en de volgorde waarin je collega zijn dobbelstenen legt zo goed mogelijk te interpreteren. Nadat alle dobbelstenen zijn ingezet en het vliegtuig nog in de lucht zweeft, begint de volgende ronde. Bereiken jullie na 7 ronden met de juiste snelheid en in horizontale positie het vliegveld, dan winnen jullie het spel. Maar de volgende zware uitdaging wacht dan alweer!
Waarom kies je voor Sky Team van 999 Games?999 Games weet wat leuke spellen zijn, geen saaie beurten tot je eindelijk uit de put komt, eeuwig durende strijd om continenten of eindeloos dobbelen om de laatste straat te kunnen kopen.

Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter? Can you make a better fist of the same hand your neighbor had? Play out rounds until all players have had each hand.

Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the governments trusted workers.Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock  Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Romn (El mundo de guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.The Red Cathedral is a strategic, Euro board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.During the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources. Each of these actions has its own mechanism and requires that the players pay close attention to what the other players are doing.When the sections of the cathedral are assigned the players take possession of the spaces in each of the columns that make up their section. The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.The Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 80 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Dice, EconomicMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Contracts, Dice Rolling, End Game Bonuses, Rondel, Solo / Solitaire Game, Victory Points as a ResourceMakersOntwerper: Isra C., Shei S.]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29091-de-rode-kathedraal.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/54015-home_default/de-rode-kathedraal.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29091-de-rode-kathedraal.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","29.95","8720289477547","999-DRK01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#846.000000}"

The more sections built and the completion of each with its own tower, the more points the player will be given at the end of the game.The players can send resources to the cathedral sections that they have claimed. When they complete each of those sections they will obtain rewards in money and prestige points. They will also be able to install decorations on the completed sections to achieve even more recognition from the Tsar. This part of the game also works as a clock, since once any player completes the construction of their sixth section it brings about the end of the game.The game board shows us the iconic rondel of The Red Cathedral. It is where the players obtain all the resource types needed to complete their work on the cathedral, as well as to get favors from the guilds and professionals to make the most of their trip to the market. In the central rondel the players choose the die they wish to use and move forward as many spaces as is shown on the top side of said die, in order to obtain the resources indicated in the space destined by the die.The Red Cathedral is a very accessible game with regard to its rules because it is very easy to understand the various levels of the game, but it remains very interesting with regard to strategy. It is sure to please those who are more interested in the challenge offered by trying to strategically optimize their position in each game rather than the complexity of the rules.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 80 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Dice, EconomicMechanisme: Area Majority / Influence, Contracts, Dice Rolling, End Game Bonuses, Rondel, Solo / Solitaire Game, Victory Points as a ResourceMakersOntwerper: Isra C., Shei S.]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29091-de-rode-kathedraal.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/54016-home_default/de-rode-kathedraal.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29091-de-rode-kathedraal.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","29.95","8720289477547","999-DRK01","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#846.000000}"

Tsar Ivan wants to see results and our team will prove to him that we are the best builders in the city. We are sure to finish off those decorative arches with the brightest shining stones and ensure our place on the list of the governments trusted workers.Sheila Santos and Israel Cendrero make up the game designing duo known as Llama Dice. To date they have put out various titles with different Spanish publishers (1987 Channel Tunnel, Mondrian, Smoothies), and The Red Cathedral is the first game they have published with Devir. Pedro Soto (Holmes, Sherlock  Mycroft, Papua) and Chema Romn (El mundo de guila Roja) took care of the graphic elements of the game with a grand homage to Ivan Bilibin, an iconic Russian artist from the turn of the twentieth century. Despite being from a far later period, his mark is very recognizable in the game.The Red Cathedral is a strategic, Euro board game in which the players take the roles of construction teams. Their job is to work together to put up St. Basil's cathedral in Moscow, as ordered by Ivan the Terrible. However, only one of them will be able to gain the favor of the Tsar.During the game, the players can carry out one of these three actions: assign a section of the cathedral, send resources to that section to build it, or go to the game board to achieve more resources.

It challenges players to build combinations of abilities, as well as to correctly calculate the advantage of delayed gratification for actions.In the game, players are merchants in Amsterdam near the turn of the 20th century. At the start of the game, two district cards are placed on each of the twelve spaces on the designated board. At the beginning of a round, the next two district cards, as well as two building and two profession cards (each from a deck of 54 of each type) are drawn to form the offer of six cards. Each of these cards has a cost in colored action cubes and grants a new action, special ability, or way to score points. In turn order, each player takes a card from those on offer. Finally, a market card is revealed that allows players to exchange money for victory points on their turn.Next, the six colored dice are rolled. Each player decides which of the six dice they would like (players may choose the same die), then takes as many action cubes in that color as the number of pips. Players place their new action cubes on their rotatable windrose as many spaces in the future as the number on the dice. Finally, the wheel is spun, so that players gain access to all cubes that were located on the 1 space of their windrose.Action cubes are used to purchase cards that a player has taken, claim one of the nine types of goods around the city of Amsterdam, and ferry goods or workers through canals to warehouses. Players earn points for delivering their goods, as well as for bonuses on cards they purchase, and the player with the most points at the end of the twelfth round wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-4Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 12+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: DiceMechanisme: Action Points, Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Network and Route Building, Open Drafting, Pick-up and Deliver, Set Collection, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Stefan Feld]]>","boardgames","89.95","0","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29135-amsterdam-essential-edition-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/54089-home_default/amsterdam-essential-edition-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29135-amsterdam-essential-edition-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","89.95","8718026305901","WGG2347","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2265.000000}"

Based on simple and intuitive hand management, Heat: Pedal to the Metal puts players in the driver's seat of intense car races, jockeying for position to cross the finish line first, while managing their car's speed if they don't want to overheat. Selecting the right upgrades for their car will help them hug the curves and keep their engine cool enough to maintain top speeds. Ultimately, their driving skills will be the key to victory!
Drivers can compete in a single race or use the ""Championship System"" to play a whole season in one game night, customizing their car before each race to claim the top spot of the podium. They have to be careful as the weather, road conditions, and events will change every race to spice up their championship. Players can also enjoy a solo mode with the Legends Module or add automated drivers as additional opponents in multiplayer games.

This expansion introduces:

One new driver w/ all essential player specific components in orange (now allows up to 7 racers)
Two new maps (Japan  Mexico)
New upgrade cards (introducing the purple drop - a different cooldown that allows the player to take a heat card from their discard pile and place it back into their engine)
Submerged track sections (must spend an extra heat for down shifting gears in these sections)
More heat, stress, championship, sponsorship, and event cards.

"b4119a05-8d02-4a90-9cd1-877cfec15109","<![CDATA[Dabba Walla]]","<![CDATA[Every morning in Mumbai, over five thousand workers dressed in white swarm out to deliver more than 200,000 dabbas (multistoried lunch boxes) to the offices of the Indian metropolis. These Dabba Walla have been an iconic fixture in the cityscape since 1890. The food is freshly prepared at home by families, then collected from their front doors by the Dabba Walla. Even though some of the dabbas travel very far, they are delivered punctually via a network of intermediate stations with an amazing reliability of 99.999%! Now it's time to join the Dabba Walla on their daily journey through Mumbai...The game Dabba Walla consists of two phases: Pick-up phase: Take turns moving your Dabba Walla through Mumbai to collect dabba cards. Each time you pick up a card, you then play one of the three in your hand to take the depicted dabba tile  a polyomino of 1-4 squares  and place it in your cart, stacking tiles higher and higher as the rounds progress. Dabbas come in four colors, and you must place them on flat surfaces, filling holes with empty dabbas if needed. If you connect two half-chai symbols on tiles on the same level, you draw a random chai tile with a bonus action. Keep all played dabba cards in a personal discard pile. Delivery phase: After everyone has placed fifteen tiles in their cart, it's time to deliver lunches! Pick up all the cards you played, then complete a number of delivery rounds equal to the highest level that someone has stacked their dabbas.

These Dabba Walla have been an iconic fixture in the cityscape since 1890. The food is freshly prepared at home by families, then collected from their front doors by the Dabba Walla. Even though some of the dabbas travel very far, they are delivered punctually via a network of intermediate stations with an amazing reliability of 99.999%! Now it's time to join the Dabba Walla on their daily journey through Mumbai...The game Dabba Walla consists of two phases: Pick-up phase: Take turns moving your Dabba Walla through Mumbai to collect dabba cards. Each time you pick up a card, you then play one of the three in your hand to take the depicted dabba tile  a polyomino of 1-4 squares  and place it in your cart, stacking tiles higher and higher as the rounds progress. Dabbas come in four colors, and you must place them on flat surfaces, filling holes with empty dabbas if needed. If you connect two half-chai symbols on tiles on the same level, you draw a random chai tile with a bonus action. Keep all played dabba cards in a personal discard pile. Delivery phase: After everyone has placed fifteen tiles in their cart, it's time to deliver lunches! Pick up all the cards you played, then complete a number of delivery rounds equal to the highest level that someone has stacked their dabbas. Each round, each player plays and reveals one dabba card from their hand, optionally playing chai tiles as well.

"5d567f19-06e3-40f6-be0f-15363e6032b1","<![CDATA[Diamant]]","<![CDATA[Diamant  also published as Incan Gold  is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety.

"9451da95-f0cd-4012-b99e-b339f9ebc54b","<![CDATA[Diamant]]","<![CDATA[Diamant  also published as Incan Gold  is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper  but at the risk of ending up with nothing.All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once.

Er zijn 24 deuren die wachten om geopend te worden, elk met een eigen 54-delige puzzel erin: het is kerstavond en de kerstman is onderweg, maar de cadeaus vallen uit zijn slee! Gebruik je verbeelding om in elkaar te zetten wat er gebeurt wanneer de cadeaus op zijn lijstje naar beneden vallen in de stad. Zal iedereen de cadeaus krijgen die ze wilden, of zal een vergissing de magie verpesten? Dit zijn de scènes waarover je moet puzzelen. Dit is Wasgij, de achterstevoren puzzel waarbij je niet de afbeelding oplost die je ziet, maar wat er zich onderaan afspeelt! Over Wasgij Deze Wasgij legpuzzels van Jumbo zijn speciaal ontwikkelt voor volwassenen. Anders dan bij andere puzzels, maak je bij Wasgij niet een afbeelding van de doos na maar moet je zelf je fantasie gebruiken om de puzzelplaat compleet te maken! Er zijn drie verschillende concepten: Original, Mystery en Destiny. Bij Wasgij Mystery moet je de hints en je fantasie gebruiken om er achter te komen hoe het tafereel er in de toekomst uit zal zien. Het unieke Wasgij concept stimuleert volwassenen om hun fantasie te gebruiken!]]>","boardgames","29.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29663-wasgij-christmas-advent-calendar.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/55058-home_default/wasgij-christmas-advent-calendar.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29663-wasgij-christmas-advent-calendar.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[Jumbo]]","29.95","8710126018729","JUM-1110101658","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#1258.000000}"

To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons  the currency/points in the game  and someone is chosen as the start player.On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn button income: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.Additionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative. The player with the most points wins.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 2Speelduur: 15 min.Leeftijd: 8+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Abstract Strategy, Economic, PuzzleMechanisme: Grid Coverage, Income, Open Drafting, Rondel, Square Grid, Tile Placement, Turn Order: Stat-Based, Turn Order: Time Track, Victory Points as a ResourceMakersOntwerper: Uwe Rosenberg]]>","boardgames","22.95","6","EUR","no","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29892-patchwork-jubileum-editie.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/55437-home_default/patchwork-jubileum-editie.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/29892-patchwork-jubileum-editie.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[999 Games]]","22.95","8720289479015","999-PAT08","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#642.000000}"

The game is played over eight rounds. At the beginning of the round, six colored dice are rolled, with players receiving a threat marker in the color of any die that rolls a 5 or 6. The black die is a wild threat, with players drawing a threat token with one of the other threat types hidden on the back. If a player ever has three of one type of threat, they receive a penalty.Next, players have the opportunity to pay a number of coins (equal to the pips on all diceshowing a 1 or 2) to advance on the mayor's track. The black die also activates the clergy in St.Michael's Church, which serves as a round counter and awards points for certain building types at the end of the game.On their turn, players play five cards from any of five stacks of cards, one for each of the five colors in the game. These cards are in thirteen categories, each representing a different location around Hamburg, with seventeen individual cards within each category. Each card in a player's hand may be used for a number of purposes, including building the city wall, activating boats (if a 3 or 4 is rolled), starting a building plot, and constructing a building (card) on the plot, with this building granting a new ability or endgame scoring condition.Players receive points for various accomplishments during the game. In addition, they may receive bonus points by being the only player to have achieved one of five conditions for that round. Whoever scores the most points after eight rounds wins.Hamburg is a reimplementation of Bruges, including The City on the Zwin and Pets expansions and some new content, with some moderate rules enhancements.AlgemeenAantal spelers: 1-5Speelduur: 60 min.Leeftijd: 10+Taal:  NederlandsSoort spelType/Thema: Card Game, City Building, EconomicMechanisme: Dice Rolling, Hand Management, Solo / Solitaire GameMakersOntwerper: Stefan Feld]]>","boardgames","74.95","6","EUR","yes","https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/30102-hamburg-essential-edition-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","https://www.spelspul.nl/55793-home_default/hamburg-essential-edition-nl.jpg","https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1509660190&as=1593318128&t=2&tk=1&gt=1&url=https://www.spelspul.nl/nl/30102-hamburg-essential-edition-nl.html?gmc_currency=1","<![CDATA[White Goblin Games]]","74.95","8718026306502","WGG2449","{google_product_category#<![CDATA[Speelgoed en spellen > Spellen > Bordspellen]]}{condition#new}{weight#2682.000000}"
